As part of a England and France trip in 2015, we wanted to visit friends who live in Oxford, so we booked a little cottage in Kingham and just down the street was this beautiful inn/pub, [The Kingham Plough](https://thekinghamplough.co.uk/). We met our friends there for dinner the night we arrived and it was a great introduction to the area!
