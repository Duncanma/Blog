Hey folks, I'm an experienced Engineering Manager, who builds high-quality, high-performance web experiences.

Currently I am working at AWS, as a manager in [their docs space](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/). My most recent previous role was an Engineering Manager at [Stripe](https://stripe.com) working on [their documentation platform](https://docs.stripe.com/). At various times I was the fellow running the team that builds [Docs.Microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com), [Azure.Microsoft.com](https://azure.microsoft.com), [Channel  9](https://channel9.msdn.com) and more. Previously I worked on [MSDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Developer_Network) as a developer, content strategist, and author.

I've written [a whole bunch of articles and books on programming topics, and a few more focused around gaming](/publications/). For a time I was the VB guy on MSDN, starting out as a sample writer and article author as part of the MSDN content team, then running the VB and C# developer centers for a time, before finally moving onto the MSDN dev team. After about a year of working on that huge system (millions of documents in 19 languages... MSDN was a big site), I took a job as a developer on Channel 9... where my first task was to help design, architect and build their new site on10.net. Eventually, through a series of poor choices (kidding!) I ended up as the dev lead on the C9 team, going on to build Channel 8, TechNet Edge, VisitMix.com, Oxite, and various event sites. About 12 years ago, I finally moved from Channel 9 over to the DevRel (developer relations) team where we built docs.microsoft.com along with many other sites.

I (as of September 2022) left Microsoft, after *23 years*, still doing that engineering management thing, still working on content systems for developers, but working at a little startup called Stripe. In January of 2025, I left Stripe and have just started at Amazon, working on [the AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/).
