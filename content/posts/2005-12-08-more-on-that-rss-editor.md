In the end, MSDN didn&#8217;t end up needing <a href="http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2005/11/01/3184.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">the RSS editor I wrote</a>, so I&#8217;ve stripped out the features and content specific to their needs and started turning it into a more generic RSS creation tool. If you&#8217;d like to see it, as it is, you can run it from <a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/FeedWriter/default.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">a ClickOnce install point here on my site</a>. There are more features coming, and I&#8217;m revamping the style and behavior of the category system&#8230;. but you can try it out against copies of your own feeds or click File | New Feed to make new ones. Check out the Validate option on the menu, it will send whatever feed you have open to a web service enabled version of the [feedvalidator.org](http://www.feedvalidator.org){.broken_link} system (coded up by [Kent Sharkey](http://www.acmebinary.com/blogs/kent/default.aspx){.broken_link}), allowing you to check the validatity of your RSS **without** having to publish the file anywhere.

Note: If you have Beta 2 of the .NET Framework installed, the Click Once application will not install or run correctly. In this case, you need to run the VS remove tool (available from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/support/uninstall/default.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">here</a>)
