I&#8217;m going to buy an album as download-only today, from <a href="http://www.buymusic.com" target="_blank" class="broken_link">www.buymusic.com</a>, and I hope it all works out as good as it sounds (no pun intended!). My biggest worry when downloading music from the various sites is that I won&#8217;t be able to fit the DRM requirements into my digital music lifestyle. I listen to music on my laptop, my home computer, on <a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/musicxp" target="_blank" class="broken_link">my music system PC</a>, on my Rio WMA player and sometimes on CDs in the car&#8230; but most of the music sites out there (that I&#8217;ve visited) didn&#8217;t seem to allow all of those uses&#8230; but buymusic.com says it allows use on 3 PCs (just enough for me to avoid moving my licenses around all the time!), on a portable device and burned onto CD a few times (10 I think). That should cover me perfectly, but I have to try it out to be sure. I think I&#8217;ll buy the new Sting album tonight for $9 something USD, and see how it goes.  
I wonder what happens when I wipe and rebuild my machine? Maybe that isn&#8217;t common for most of their customers, but it certainly is a regular occurence for me!
