My wife had read about this cool guy when working on a new article for Parent Map (<a href="http://parentmap.com/june_06/0606_2c.htm" target="_blank" class="broken_link">"Help kids handle use of handhelds"</a>) and I was intrigued, so <a href="http://www.osakasteve.com" target="_blank">Jesse</a> and I took a trip over to Seattle and <a href="http://on10.net/Blogs/Raw/3420/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">interviewed him for on10.net</a>. It is a slightly different style of video than what you are used to from on10.net, but you can expect to see a wide variety of topics and styles on the site over time. This is also Jesse&#8217;s first video on 10, so let us know what you thought!
