No idea what we&#8217;ve caught, but everyone in my family is sick&#8230;. and it has lasted for three days so far. Fever, shivering, sniffling, coughing, ugh&#8230; This was the first year that we all got flu shots and I&#8217;ll tell you, we have never been sick so often ðŸ™‚

Of course, it is also Connor&#8217;s first year in pre-school, so that could be a more likely cause&#8230; all those germ-buckets playing together can really spread a cold around.
