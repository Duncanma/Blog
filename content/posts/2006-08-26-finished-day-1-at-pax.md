So I&#8217;ve been wanting to go to <a href="http://www.pennyarcadeexpo.com" target="_blank">PAX</a> since it started a couple of years ago, and every time it has come around I&#8217;ve been out of town&#8230; until now&#8230; and, by some interesting twist of fate, I know <a href="http://www.on10.net/Blogs/TheShow/5132/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">have a job that actually required me to attend</a> ðŸ™‚

So <a href="http://www.tinawood.net/" target="_blank">Tina</a>, Sampy, <a href="http://adamkinney.com" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Adam</a> and I headed over there today, snuck in ahead of the massive line with our snazzy media badges and started filming&#8230; some highlights

  * Serving &#8220;BAWLS&#8221; everywhere leads to <a href="http://www.kinetixgaming.com/forums/index.php?PHPSESSID=429dd3fafa968a71f390a8670b5e075a&topic=406.0" target="_blank" class="broken_link">many great quotes</a>, especially funny if you are 9 years old, but we laughed anyway
  * Console Tourney&#8230; competive Smash Bros, how much cooler can it get?

  * Case Mods in the Bring Your Own Computer room, I&#8217;m already voting for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Penny_Arcade_characters#Minor_Characters" target="_blank">FF 2000</a> case to win hands down. It was so cool that both Sampy and myself interviewed them (that is what happens when we split up and give two devs each a camera&#8230; silly us).

Note that this is an &#8220;in progress&#8221; pic, not the final case mod&#8230; I&#8217;ll post that soon&#8230; check out <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/theadam/tags/fruitfucker" target="_blank">this photo set for the whole mod in pictures</a>.

  * Alex St. John&#8230; wow&#8230; cigars&#8230; stories&#8230; and brave enough to bring his daughters to an event with many thousand gamers (the # of black shirts on the streets of Bellevue was unbelievable).
