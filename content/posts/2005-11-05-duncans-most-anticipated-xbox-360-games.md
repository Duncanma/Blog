<a href="http://www.bufferoverrun.net" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Brian</a> and I have been spending a lot of our free time working on an upcoming Xbox 360 book (<a href="http://www.xbox4dummies.com" title="Xbox 360 for Dummies" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Xbox 360 for Dummies</a>), which has resulted in me spending way too much time thinking about the day I will be able to pick up a box of my own to bring home. Looking forward to that day, and knowing that Brian and I have almost completely different tastes in games, I thought it would be interesting to list out the 5 games on the 360 I&#8217;m most looking forward to, and maybe Brian will do the same. I&#8217;m not going to restrict myself to just launch titles, going instead for anything that has been announced, mainly so that I can include my #1 most anticipated title:

  1. **<a href="http://masseffect.bioware.com/" title="Mass Effect by Bioware" target="_blank">Bioware&#8217;s Mass Effect</a>**  
    An RPG set in space&#8230; with great potential based on Bioware&#8217;s past releases (KOTOR and Jade Empire being two of my favorite Xbox 1 games)&#8230;
  2. **<a href="http://www.elderscrolls.com" title="The Elder Scrolls" target="_blank">The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion</a>**  
    Another RPG, this one a more classic swords & sorcery style system&#8230; I&#8217;ve never played any of the earlier releases in this series though, so I might have missed out on some great games
  3. **<a href="http://www.kameo.com" title="Kameo: Elements of Power" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Kameo: Elements of Power</a>**  
    I don&#8217;t know how to classify this game, but it looks great and the gameplay I&#8217;ve seen looks like a lot of fun&#8230; probably something that will be popular to play with my kids
  4. **<a href="http://www.perfectdarkzero.com" title="don't send her to visit me!" target="_blank">Perfect Dark Zero</a>**  
    It is a first person shooter&#8230; I like those&#8230; it won&#8217;t be as scary as Quake IV (I played the original Quake mostly around midnight in a dark apartment and it gave me the creeps on many occasions) and it has a sexy protagonist&#8230; yeah, I&#8217;ll be picking this one up.
  5. **<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/p/projectgothamracing3/default.htm" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Project Gotham Racing 3</a>**  
    I like driving games&#8230; I feel a little bit torn about buying PGR 3, because I didn&#8217;t end up having time to play the last PGR game (I feel like I should go back and play it a ton before buying the next one, otherwise it seems wasteful&#8230;) so that guilt and the fact that different games will be out by the time I get to buying game #5 means that I might end up going for <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/k/kingkongxbox360/" title="King Kong" target="_blank" class="broken_link">King Kong</a>, <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/d/deadoralive4/default.htm" target="_blank" class="broken_link">DOA 4</a>, or &#8230;

What I will probably do is buy one when I get the console, another one around christmas and put a bunch of 360 games into my <a title="GameFly.com" href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1559417-10195038" target="_blank">GameFly</a> queue as soon as they are available so that I can try out as many as possible before I decide which ones to buy.
