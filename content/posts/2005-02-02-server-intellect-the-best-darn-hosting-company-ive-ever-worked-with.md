I&#8217;ve mentioned it <a href="http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2004/09/02/626.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">before</a>, but it is worth saying again. When I decided to build my site up from its static beginnings and add on various asp.net-driven <a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/Forums/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">applications</a>, I needed a host that provided SQL Server database access for a reasonable fee and easerve (<a href="http://www.serverintellect.com/host/duncanma/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Server Intellect</a>&#8216;s old name) came <a href="http://www.pinvoke.net" target="_blank">highly recommended</a>. Turns out to be the best hosting decision I have ever made.

Once I realized the level of support and stability that this host provided, I decided to move my personal blog onto my own installation of .Text at <a href="" target="_blank">http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net</a>. At the time, my blog was being used to populate the Visual Basic and C# developer center home pages at MSDN (and it is still used for the VB home page), so it was very &#8220;mission critical&#8221; for my job and for the site. The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic" target="_blank">Visual Basic developer center</a> is one of the most popular pages on a very high-traffic site; I was placing a lot of faith on Server Intellect&#8217;s ability to deliver my content reliably. I haven&#8217;t had a single issue with the uptime or performance of my feed since that time, so I guess my faith was well placed. At one point, due to a little bug at the MSDN side of things, my feed wasn&#8217;t even being cached and was retrieved once for every single hit to the VB and C# developer centers&#8230;. so Server Intellect contacted me and let me know that they were removing my bandwidth cap to make sure I didn&#8217;t run into any issues until we could resolve the issue on the MSDN side&#8230;. 

Anyway, enough gushing, here&#8217;s my point: I&#8217;m very happy with <a href="http://www.serverintellect.com/host/duncanma/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">my web host</a>, and I don&#8217;t think I would have felt comfortable moving my blog off of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com" target="_blank">blogs.msdn.com</a> onto any other company&#8217;s servers&#8230;. if that information helps you to pick a web host of your own, that&#8217;s great :), especially if you end up running a bunch of ASP.NET code on your new site!
