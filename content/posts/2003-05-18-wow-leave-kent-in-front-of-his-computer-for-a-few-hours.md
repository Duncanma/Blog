and look at [the stuff he produces](http://dotnetweblogs.com/ksharkey/posts/7176.aspx){.broken_link}. Pretty cool, although I&#8217;m still planning to add the GUID and other attributes to the source doc&#8230; otherwise we will be creating new GUIDs on every trip (is that a big deal? it isn&#8217;t like we are going to run out of them soon, but I hate to be wasteful)&#8230; of course, you would all be even more impressed with the man if you had seen all the code and XML samples he sent via email at the same time.

Of course, it is all balanced out by the fact that he called me &#8220;Tool Kitten&#8221;, so I guess he is back to zero.
