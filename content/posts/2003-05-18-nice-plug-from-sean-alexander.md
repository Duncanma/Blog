[Sean](http://EraBlog.NET/filters/12154.post){.broken_link} mentions my [last article,](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun04252003.asp) which was all about [the new WMP 9 &#8220;blogging&#8221; plug-in.](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/expertzone/columns/robinson/03april17.asp){.broken_link} To answer the question asked in [his comments](http://blogs.eraserver.net/blogs/sean/default.aspx?eraPostID=12154#comments){.broken_link}, yes&#8230; grabbing the dll and regsvr32&#8217;ing it will allow it to work on Windows Server 2003&#8230; or even on Longhorn if [you](http://www.sellsbrothers.com){.broken_link} are into that sort of thing&#8230; 

Of course, I&#8217;d suggest that you don&#8217;t run WMP9, IE, or blogging client software on your Windows Server, but I don&#8217;t want to sound _crazy_
