As my lack of posts might suggest, I&#8217;m completely under water these days at work, but I did find time to take a week long vacation back to Winnipeg, Manitoba. While I was there I snapped this shot of a sign that I&#8217;ve been amused by for a few years now&#8230; (click the picture to see the full size version)

I can only imagine someone driving down the road, seeing the sign and thinking&#8230; &#8220;hmm&#8230; that&#8217;s not a bad price, maybe I should take advantage of that right now on the way home&#8230; I **have** been feeling a bit run down lately.&#8221;
