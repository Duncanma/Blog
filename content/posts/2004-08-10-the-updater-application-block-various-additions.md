One of the nice things about [the Updater Application Block](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=83c68646-befb-4586-ba9f-fdf1301902f5){.broken_link} is that it was written to be quite extensible&#8230; I saw [a post today](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/MessageBoard/Thread.aspx?id=251828&Page=1#252347){.broken_link} where SamSantiago mentioned [he had created a custom class](http://www.softitechture.com/discussions/){.broken_link} to delete all those old versions on your machine whenever you do an update&#8230;. very cool, I&#8217;ll be trying that out right away&#8230; 

Personally, I&#8217;ve _updated the updater_ in [a few different ways](http://weblogs.asp.net/duncanma/archive/2003/08/12/23901.aspx){.broken_link}, but the most recent changes have been the most reusable, in my opinon;

  * I fixed the code so that it no longer requires users to have admin rights&#8230;
  * I added a &#8216;mandatory&#8217; flag to the updates (and updated the manifestutility in a few different ways), so that for some updates the client app would know not to ask the user if they want to upgrade&#8230; great for occasionally forcing everyone up to the same build&#8230;
  * and I modified the manifest retrieval code so that it can call an ASP or ASP.NET page, which in turn allowed me to create a manifest.aspx page that returns different manifests based on the user&#8217;s credentials (so I can have a &#8216;beta&#8217; group who are given one version, and everyone else gets the last major release&#8230;)

I&#8217;ve got to work out a way to get these bits of code online&#8230;. it isn&#8217;t hard, but it takes time that I haven&#8217;t planned in yet ðŸ™‚
