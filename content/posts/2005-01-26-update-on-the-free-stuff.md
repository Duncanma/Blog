I few people emailed me to ask if the various free (referral based) offers out there are working for me&#8230; well, yes and no. I have 4 out of the 8 referrals required for <a href="http://www.freeflatscreens.com/?r=13882371" target="_blank">a free flat screen</a>, 1 out of 11 for the <a href="http://www.freeminimacs.com/?r=13892191" target="_blank">free mini mac</a> and none for the <a href="http://www.pvps4free.com/default.aspx?r=160508" target="_blank">free Personal Video Player</a>&#8230; which makes sense actually, I blogged about the first, I&#8217;ve never really talked about the mini mac one, but there is a little button link on this page so it gets a little bit of traffic, and I have never before mentioned the video player one&#8230; so it isn&#8217;t getting any traffic at all.

There is hope that <a href="http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2005/01/13/990.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">the conga line concept</a> will work though; in the end the best bet might be to just sign up for a few of these congas and then try to ignore the whole thing and be pleasantly surprised if you get anything at all ðŸ™‚
