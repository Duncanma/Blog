I send myself email&#8230; which sounds more pathetic than it is. I just use it as a way to hang onto links or notes to myself (do this, watch <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/episode.aspx?xml=episodes/en/20060831MobileRB/manifest.xml" target="_blank">this</a>, etc&#8230;). I do it all the time. Every once in awhile though, right after I send something to myself I see the &#8216;new mail&#8217; pop up on my computer and I click on it wondering &#8216;hey, what&#8217;s that&#8230;&#8217;. And then I feel silly.
