Wanted to get this into a better place for discussion than my blog comments&#8230;. new forums <a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/Forums/default.aspx?ForumGroupID=5" target="_blank" class="broken_link">here</a> &#8230; I should warn you though that I&#8217;ve been having a ton of errors with the Forum code of late though. I&#8217;ve even turned on full errors (bad, bad, duncan) as part of a desperate attempt to track down an annoying error in AspNetForums.Components.SiteUrls.LocationKey() &#8230;
