It seems like I just got back from the PDC&#8230; I opened my laptop for the first time today, which isn&#8217;t to say I wasn&#8217;t working&#8230; I have email and access to update the various sites I&#8217;m working on from other machines&#8230; but I certainly wasn&#8217;t coding. Anyway, the # of unread posts in SharpReader is just ridiculous, probably going to be the incentive to clean out my subscription list&#8230;

I thought I should remind folks that a variety of Visual Basic Whidbey information has been posted up at <http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/whidbey>{.broken_link} in case that URL never made it around during the madness of information overload that was the PDC. 

Speaking of the PDC, I&#8217;ll be switching [PDC Central](http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc/) over to a &#8216;static&#8217; state today, so it will still have all of [the session materials](http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc/agendaandsessions/sessions) and all of the [&#8220;after the PDC&#8221; info](http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc/after/), but it will direct you to other place for information on the key PDC topics of [Whidbey](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/productinfo/roadmap.aspx){.broken_link}, [Yukon](http://msdn.microsoft.com/sql) and [Longhorn](http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn){.broken_link}.
