I see by <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/ksharkey/posts/31496.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Kent&#8217;s latest post</a> that we&#8217;ve gone public with our new aliases.. in the great tradition of <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0117167/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Early and Adopter</a>, we have decided we should be known as &#8216;adhoc and random&#8217;. Details won&#8217;t be coming, but let&#8217;s just say that we have a reputation at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com" target="_blank">our workplace</a> as being a bit too quick to write and ship code when we want something done&#8230;

We are working on that problem though&#8230; I think we are scheduled to attend a support group next week, and we aren&#8217;t allowed to code during the meeting&#8230;. 

Oh, and the PDC <font color="#0000ff">is almost </font>sold out&#8230; wow&#8230; and in a year where conferences having been doing badly in general, that is quite impressive.
