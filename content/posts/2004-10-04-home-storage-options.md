As [Chris](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=1531){.broken_link} already noticed, [Charlie Kindel](http://www.kindel.com/blogs/charlie){.broken_link} is discussing home data storage and home servers&#8230; both topics that interest me for about the same reasons as Chris. I&#8217;m a big fan of Windows Media Center, I have a ton of WMA files, digital photos, and I&#8217;m starting to have 3 seperate places where I store digital recordings of my TV shows&#8230;

If you are into home networking, storage and servers&#8230; Charlie&#8217;s blog is worth reading.
