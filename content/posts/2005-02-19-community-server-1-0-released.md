> Telligent Systems, the company founded by former Microsoftie (and ASP.NET whiz kid) Rob Howard, has finally released Community Server 1.0. Community Server combines the functionality of forums (based on the ASP.NET forums engine Rob worked on while at Microsoft), blogs (based on the very popular .Text engine created by Scott Watermasysk, who now works for Telligent), and photo gallery (based on nGallery, created by Jason Alexander, who&#8217;s also one of the brains at Telligent).

> Congrats to the Telligent team&#8230;I&#8217;m looking forward to trying out CS 1.0 for my personal blog, which is currently running on an older version of .Text.
