I was browsing on [www.xamlog.com](http://www.xamlog.com) and I found this tutorial on &#8220;<a href="http://www.xamlog.com/2006/07/30/reflection-using-visual-brush-and-opacity-mask/" target="_blank">Reflection using Visual Brush and Opacity Mask</a>&#8220;, which shows you how to produce this effect:

 <img height="208" src="http://www.xamlog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/reflection_08.jpg" width="240" />

with very little code/markup.

Hmm&#8230; now that I finally have Vista up and running, it might be worth giving it a try.
