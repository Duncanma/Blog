I use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/ehab.asp" target="_blank" class="broken_link">the Exception Handling Block from PAG</a>, so exceptions anywhere in my application generate a nice (full of data) XML file for me to use after the fact to track down the problem&#8230; but that file gets written to the user&#8217;s local machine&#8230; so I have to ask folks to send it to me via email. What I need to implement is some system to upload those reports to me either automatically or on-demand&#8230;. Perhaps on application start I should check for the existance of an &#8216;exception file&#8217;, ask the user if they would like to submit a bug report into our bug tracking software&#8230; attach the file and then delete it?

Yeah, that might work&#8230;
