Ok, if you are a programmer&#8230; or even if you just can relate enough that you think Office Space is one of the best movies in the world (doesn&#8217;t everyone?) then I need you to do this:

  * Go to <a href="http://www.jonathancoulton.com/songs" target="_blank">http://www.jonathancoulton.com/songs</a>
  * Scroll down to &#8220;Thing a Week III&#8221;
  * Click on the play button next to Code Monkey

Enjoy!

Oh, and since I went there today&#8230; here is another selection from Jonathan&#8217;s site: <a href="http://www.jonathancoulton.com/mp3/Ikea.mp3" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Ikea.mp3</a>
