I had planned on missing this year&#8217;s <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc" target="_blank">PDC</a>, because we had been planning on launching a new application during that same week (one of many!!)&#8230; but now that particular launch has been postponed a bit so I&#8217;m free to attend! That wouldn&#8217;t have made any difference though, since it is sold out (and yes, that applies to us staffers too!), but I&#8217;ve just taken over from another colleague who won&#8217;t be able to attend&#8230; so off I go to buy an overly expensive last minute ticket!

See you folks there!

_Oh, and w.bloggar is working again, so I&#8217;m a happy blogger!_
