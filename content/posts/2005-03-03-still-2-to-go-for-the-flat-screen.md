Sign-ups seem to have plateaued, <a href="http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2005/02/16/1116.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">I posted that I had 2 left</a> for <a href="http://www.freeflatscreens.com/?r=13882371" target="_blank">the free flat screen site</a> on February 16th, and I&#8217;m still at the same point. What I do have though, is about 15 &#8220;yellows&#8221; which means a person signed up but never completed an offer&#8230; everyone starts out yellow before going to &#8220;green&#8221; and becoming a valid referral counting towards the number you need, so all those yellows can lead to a false sense of accomplishment :). If anyone is interested in signing up, I strongly recommend <a href="http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2005/02/25/1149.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">the zooba.com offer</a>, it is easy and seems to be a pretty good deal.
