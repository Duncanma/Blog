So I&#8217;m back from the San Francisco area, and I&#8217;m while I&#8217;m too tired to give you all the details right now, here&#8217;s a sneak peak of some of the things you&#8217;ll be seeing on 10 in the near future:

Update 2: For some reason, this post is #1 on several search engines for the query &#8220;How hot is a flamethrower&#8221;&#8230; and I suspect that people who find this entry aren&#8217;t really getting that question answered ðŸ™‚ In the interest of helping those folks out, I&#8217;ve dug up a bit of an answer.

Turns out it is a hard question to find the answer to, although searching on &#8220;temperature&#8221; and &#8220;flamethrower&#8221; works better than &#8220;hot&#8221;. I&#8217;ve seen varying reports, but as far as I can tell most flamethrowers used by the miltary used thickened gasoline (napalm) as their fuel &#8230; which can reach a temperature of approx. 1200 Â°C (from&nbsp;<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napalm>&nbsp;with more info at&nbsp;<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamethrower>). It is worth noting that the use of Flamethrowers by the US Military was ended in 1978.&nbsp;
