I read an interesting and well researched article about treadmill running vs. outdoor running&#8230; <a href="http://mysite.verizon.net/jim2wr/id110.html" target="_blank" class="broken_link">The 1% Incline Treadmill Myth</a>, and I certainly agree with the conclusion that air resistance has little or no effect on a runner at relatively low speeds (compared to world-class runners that is). I do find running outside harder though, for a few reasons&#8230; one is that the ground is generally less forgiving than the treadmills I use at the Pro Club, and two is that in my part of the world&#8230; there is really no such thing as a &#8216;flat&#8217; course. Even the simplest 3 mile loop around my area generally has about 150 ft down and 150 ft up &#8230;. and that is on roads that barely seem to be inclined at all to the eye.

For me, I normally have been running at 0%, but lately I&#8217;ve been experimenting with a variety of paces and inclines, I ran two miles last week at 5% for example&#8230; I feel it will do nothing but help my speed/endurance on relatively flat courses.
