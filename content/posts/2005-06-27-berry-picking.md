It was a very enjoyable summer weekend for our little family, including a trip today to pick raspberries (tons of fun, easy to pick&#8230;) and strawberries (very tasty&#8230; but much less enjoyable to be squatting down in the tiny little space between the rows trying to dig through the little bushes looking for ripe strawberries&#8230;) out at a local place called <a href="http://www.RemlingerFarms.com" target="_blank">Remlinger Farms</a>.

With a bit of &#8216;low-carb&#8217; ice cream, they taste wonderful&#8230; but quite a few just went straight from the bowl into the mouth&#8230;
