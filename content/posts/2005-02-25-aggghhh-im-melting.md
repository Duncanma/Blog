_or am I being scribbled?_ 

I just noticed that the staged version of the VB developer center (our pre-production version where we publish the site prior to pushing it live) has <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brad_mccabe/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Brad&#8217;s</a> picture and blog on the home page&#8230; making this my last post that will show up on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic" target="_blank">that page</a> ðŸ™‚

Of course, my blog isn&#8217;t going away, but you get to look at someone else&#8217;s face and commentary on MSDN instead of me! It&#8217;s been fun though, and hopefully useful or at least entertaining to a few of you VB developers out there too ðŸ™‚
