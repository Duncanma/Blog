Well, those demos have certainly floored me&#8230; but I must say I&#8217;m torn. 

As a Microsoft guy, I&#8217;m pretty pumped about all of the new stuff&#8230; but as a developer, I have to admit a feeling of sadness seeing all of this cool code (mostly the Avalon and WinFS stuff for me) that I won&#8217;t be able to write into a production app for quite some time.

Duncan&#8217;s big takeaway? I need to bump up the CPU, GPU and memory on [my music machine](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/musicxp){.broken_link} so that, at least at home, I can run Longhorn on it and write all of the UI using Avalon!
