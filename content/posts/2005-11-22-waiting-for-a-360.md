Swung by Best Buy in Bellevue today, line stretched out from the store all the way around the parking lot and over to the near by Home Depot&#8230; tents, heating lamps, chairs&#8230; even hot food being brought in. The guy in the front of the line, who I believe will get his Xbox 360 from Bill Gates, had been waiting since Friday.

Stopped by Fred Meyer tonight to print out a digital photo, asked the guy if they were getting any 360 buzz&#8230; they have 12 premium systems to sell, opening at 7am, and already over a 100 calls asking when they opened and when the line was going to start&#8230; that is going to be a lot of disappointed folks&#8230;

Hmm&#8230;. January Xbox 360 for me, I think!!
