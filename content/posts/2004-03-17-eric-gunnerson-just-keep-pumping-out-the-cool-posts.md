If you follow [Eric&#8217;s blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu) (and if you are into C#, you should) then you&#8217;ll have already seen these&#8230; but if you haven&#8217;t then let these three posts be just a taste of what is available [over there](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu);

>  _&#8230; The feedback we got around E&C has been fairly polarized. There is one group who feels the way Rich does, and really wants E&C. There is another group that actively doesn&#8217;t want E&C, as they feel that it encourages the wrong kind of programming. And then there&#8217;s a group in the middle who typically see the value of E&C but don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s critical. &#8230;_

(aside &#8211; How many of you &#8211; and be honest here &#8211; have ever heard of machines where the word size wasn&#8217;t a multiple of 8? They really did exist)._

> _Rather [than] bore my audience by presenting my views on implementing IDisposable, I&#8217;m going to take the “What&#8217;s wrong with this code?” approach. My goal is to present code examples that show code that&#8217;s doing something wrong &#8211; be it something prohibited by the language, something that&#8217;s ill-advised, or something with bad performance &#8211; and then let the attendees try to figure out what&#8217;s wrong with the code._
