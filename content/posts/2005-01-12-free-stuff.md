I read <a href="http://www.pvponline.com/archive.php3?archive=20050109" target="_blank" class="broken_link">this PVP cartoon</a> last week, talking about the free iPod thing, and now I&#8217;ve seen similar things (free dvds, free pcs, free video games, etc&#8230;) from the <a href="http://www.gratisnetwork.com/default.html" target="_blank" class="broken_link">same company</a>. After reading <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1771223899144212" target="_blank" class="broken_link">about it</a>, **I gave in**.

I signed up for the Columbia deal personally, though the blockbuster offer seems &#8216;free-er&#8217; &#8230; the whole thing is probably another one of those &#8220;sign up for the free offer, because we know you are too lazy to remember to cancel before we start charging you money&#8221; deals&#8230; so check it out at your own risk ðŸ™‚

Here is **my** <a href="http://www.freeflatscreens.com/?r=13882371" target="_blank">link to the flat screen offer</a>&#8230; <a href="http://www.freeminimacs.com/?r=13892191" target="_blank">and one to the MiniMac offer</a> **which add to my referral count**, and here is a normal, no codes, link in case you&#8217;d rather <a href="http://www.freeflatscreens.com/" target="_blank">check it out without any baggage</a>. ðŸ™‚
