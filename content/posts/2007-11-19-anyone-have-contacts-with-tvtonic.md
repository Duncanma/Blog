One of their users emailed us to comment on our video quality&#8230; essentially pointing out that it sucked when viewed through their TV using TV Tonic. Well I was puzzled because, while we don&#8217;t ship out DVD quality video, our high quality download is quite good for a podcast. Turns out though, after installing TV Tonic and picking on10.net out of their catalog, that the feed they have in their system is our 512kbps WMV feed&#8230; which is certainly not the best quality around, around 430kbps for video and 320&#215;240&#8230; fine for display on our site, but not the hottest around&#8230; instead <a href="http://on10.net/feeds/rss/wmvhigh/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">they should be using our WMV (high quality) feed</a> (2500 kbps, 640 x 480), but I have no idea how to tell them about it. I&#8217;ve emailed their support address, but didn&#8217;t ever hear back from them&#8230;.
