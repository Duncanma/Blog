If you sign up for one of the sites created by Gratis (<a href="http://www.FreeFlatScreens.com/?r=13882371" target="_blank">free flat screens</a>, <a href="http://www.freeiPods.com/?r=14756414" target="_blank">free ipods</a>, <a href="http://www.FreeHandbags.com/?r=14980492" target="_blank" class="broken_link">free handbags</a>, etc&#8230;) then one of the available offers is Zooba.com, and I have to say it is one of the best offers I&#8217;ve tried. Basically, if you are someone who likes to read then you probably won&#8217;t mind the &#8216;requirement&#8217; to complete this offer. You sign up for a membership with Zooba, which costs around $10 a month and for that fee you get one hardcover book each month with no shipping costs. I&#8217;m not positive, but it seems to me that $10 is a good price for a hardcover book, and not even all that bad if you are used to paperbacks. I filled my queue on their site with 5 books that I liked, but my understanding is that you can cancel after only two book purchases, so the only real question is whether or not there are at least 2 books available through their site that you want to get anyway&#8230;

The book I received, by the way, was **The Last Light of the Sun** by one of my favorite authors: <a href="http://www.brightweavings.com/" target="_blank">Guy Gavriel Kay</a>. If you haven&#8217;t read any of his other books, I would definitely recommend **Tigana**, **The Fionavar Tapestry** (3 books) and all the rest of his writings ðŸ™‚
