Back in June I published [a column](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/using/columns/code4fun/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun06272003.asp){.broken_link} showing you how to make a simple Pocket PC remote for Windows Media player. I didn&#8217;t know it at the time, but some of my readers have sent in links to [a professional version of the same idea](http://www.zerama.net/). Built using the .NET Framework 1.1 and C#, [Zerama](http://www.zerama.net/) looks amazing&#8230; everything I wanted in mine, but built and supported by someone else (I love to code, but I&#8217;m happy to have someone else do it for me too!).
  


Check it out, pull down the demo from [here](http://www.zerama.net/download2.aspx){.broken_link} and then you can buy the full version for only $20.00.

Very cool stuff&#8230; even handles radio favorites and video content from your library!

Oh, and in case you are wondering&#8230; no kickbacks involved here folks&#8230; I&#8217;m just excited to see cool media related code created using .NET!
