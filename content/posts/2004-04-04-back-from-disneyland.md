Very little to say&#8230; I had a great time (and maybe I&#8217;ll talk about that later, but it is pretty far off-topic from my normal &#8216;content&#8217;), but now I have hundreds of emails to dig through&#8230; most of them have resolved themselves (they emailed me&#8230; Exchange bounced an Out-Of-Office back to them&#8230; they dealt with it on their own) but sadly when the problem goes away the email doesn&#8217;t (wouldn&#8217;t it be cool if it did?), so I have to look through them and make sure I haven&#8217;t missed any outstanding tasks or questions 🙁

I managed to go the week with only one quick email check&#8230; I connected to check on something else and made the mistake of syncing up my email just out of habit.

Anyway, the biggest thing to have happened while I was gone (at least from my point of view 🙂 ) was that my colleague and friend started a blog at <http://ajayan.blogspot.com>. If you are interested in meditation and spirituality, I expect that you will enjoy his blog. I&#8217;m subscribed and looking forward to more thought-provoking posts!!
