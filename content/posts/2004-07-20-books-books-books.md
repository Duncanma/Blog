I&#8217;ve been thinking about books and the MSDN developer centers for some time&#8230; I&#8217;ve been wondering what we should do in terms of highlighting books on the MSDN site.

  * Do you want **reviews**? 
      * **Top x Books** by topic area (Beginning VB.NET, Data Access, Windows Forms, Language Focused&#8230;)? How would &#8220;Top&#8221; be determined though? Top could be sales #s, votes on some sort of dynamic site (which one, who should host this&#8230; INETA, [http://www.dotnetbooks.com](http://www.dotnetbooks.com/)) ? 
          * **My favorite books?** (which means [Chris&#8217;s](http://www.sellsbrothers.com){.broken_link} favorites on [Longhorn](http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn){.broken_link}, Kent&#8217;s on [ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/asp.net), [Brian&#8217;s](http://weblogs.asp.net/brianjo){.broken_link} on [C++](http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc), etc&#8230;) 
              * **MVP Reviews**? 
                  * **No books** at all? (You&#8217;ll just use other sites to find .NET books?) 
                      * **Sample Chapters**? 
                          * Or, should we just **feature them all** (by topic) and rotate them through for highlighting?

I could set up a poll for this, but I think the discussion will be more useful so please use the comments section to voice your thoughts!!
