Justin worked (and still works?) on the Terrarium system and uses that experience as an example as he discusses various gaming topics in his blog&#8230; including yesterday&#8217;s post on creating random world content.

> _Generating random world content is one of those tasks that gets written off as a trivial matter. It isn&#8217;t hard to throw some stuff around a virtual space and call it good. However, after trivializing the world content generation during your first game, you&#8217;ll never make the same mistake twice. You should set aside quite a bit of time to think about your algorithms, employ consistency checks early on, and future proof your algorithms against later enhancements. Exactly how much time you should set aside is a project planning consideration based on how complex your world content is going to be.
