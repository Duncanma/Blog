In Halo 3 multi-player you can customize your SPARTAN or Elite&#8217;s armor, with different variations unlocked by various achievements/activities in game (including one that can only be unlocked by being a Bungie employee). <a href="http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Armor_Permutations" target="_blank">You can find out more about the different variations here</a>, but it turns out that <a href="http://www.bungie.net/Stats/Halo3/Default.aspx?player=Festive%20Turkey" target="_blank">your profile on Bungie.net</a> knows what choices you&#8217;ve made and displays your current armor configuration on the web site. 

If you go to the <a href="http://www.zaamit.com/h3-model-generator/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Halo 3 Model Generator</a> though, created by a community member, you can find the picture of any particular gamer you&#8217;d like (including yourself, which is how I found my picture, below) or create a custom image to plan out your own armor customizations.

What I&#8217;d really like to create is a live URL, one like /getpicture.ashx?GamerTag=Festive+Turkey, so that I could put my picture on my site and have it automatically update as I change my armor configuration in the game&#8230; hopefully ending up like this
