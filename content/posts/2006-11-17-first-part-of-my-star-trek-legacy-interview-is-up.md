We chatted about Star Trek games, Artificial Intelligence and Bulldogs&#8230; not in any particular order. This is just part 1 of my trip to Mad Doc, more gameplay footage of both the single and multi-player game is coming soon!<img height="1" alt="" src="http://on10.net/Blogs/duncan/mad-doc-software-and-star-trek-legacy/aggbug.aspx" width="1" />
