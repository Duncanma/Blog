I stopped at Starbucks in Redmond today on my way into work, and the drive thru was really backed up so I decided to run inside. Well, that was lucky for me because I got to see and play with the latest expansion to their service offerings, the ability to <a href="http://www.starbucks.com/hearmusic" target="_blank" class="broken_link">pick songs and burn them onto CD</a> right there in the store. I picked out a few (7) songs and a few minutes later I had my very own little compilation complete with a color picture on the CD itself (chosen by me, for a list of images) a case and a custom printed liner with the picture that I chose for the CD. Very cool, and now I have that new Cake song (No Phone) on CD ðŸ™‚
