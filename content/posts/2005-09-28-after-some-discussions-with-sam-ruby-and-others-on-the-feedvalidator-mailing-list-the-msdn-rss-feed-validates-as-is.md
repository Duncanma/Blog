In <a href="http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2005/09/26/2940.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">an earlier post</a>, I discussed the fact that the MSDN feeds were failing to validate due to a MIME type that included parameters (charset in this case, like &#8216;text/html ;charset=utf-8&#8217;), but I also posted a query about this issue into <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=8314757&forum_id=37467" target="_blank" class="broken_link">the listserv for FeedValidator.org</a>. Sam mentioned it <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2005/09/27/Enclosure-type-parameters" target="_blank">on his blog</a>, and then went ahead and updated the validator to recognize a MIME type with parameter as valid.

In the meantime, I updated the MSDN generator to strip out the parameters :), but I still think they are technically valid so I&#8217;m glad the feed <a href="http://www.feedvalidator.org/check.cgi?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmsdn.microsoft.com%2Frss.xml" target="_blank" class="broken_link">validates</a> as it is today (with params) and as it will exist in the near future with the MIME types stripped down to just type/subtype.
