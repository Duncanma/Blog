On the various programming forums I read, a common question is &#8220;how can I find out the IP address of my router&#8221;&#8230; for whatever reason (and there certainly are a few reasons that I can think of) people were really looking for their IP address on the Internet. In general, the solution was to hit one of a few publically available sites out there that display your IP when you view their web pages and then scrape the IP address back out of the HTML. Simple enough, but I thought I would make it simpler for anyone who needed this solution by creating <a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/Services" target="_blank" class="broken_link">a quick and simple web service</a>.
