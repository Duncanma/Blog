With their [SDK](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msn/msnsearch/){.broken_link}, [search results as RSS](http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=MSDN+site%3aduncanmackenzie.net&format=rss&FORM=RSRE), and ability to limit searches by site (so you can do queries like [MSDN site:duncanmackenzie.net](http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=MSDN+site%3Aduncanmackenzie.net&FORM=QBRE)), I think I&#8217;ll be able to provide a nice little &#8216;cross property&#8217; search for my blog and my personal site. Replacing the google search box on my site isn&#8217;t a big priority for me, but writing this widget might be useful to other folks as well&#8230; but until MSN gets an AdSense like program, Google is likely to own at least a part of my web site real estate ðŸ™‚
