Landed in Vegas for the <a href="http://www.devconnections.com/shows/aspfall2005/default.asp?s=65" target="_blank">conference</a>, talk is on Thursday&#8230;. I&#8217;ll be talking about <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com" target="_blank">MSDN2.microsoft.com</a>, but more specifically I&#8217;ll be covering the use of the Virtual Page Provider feature in ASP.NET 2.0, so if that type of thing appeals to you, come by and check it out!
