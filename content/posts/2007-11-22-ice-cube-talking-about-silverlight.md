and the Group Manager of Platform Evangelism at Adobe feels the need to comment about it.

Let me summarize. [Ice Cube is involved in an Internet video project and has chosen to use Silverlight](http://blogs.msdn.com/synergist/archive/2007/11/20/ice-cube-s-uvntv-com-goes-live-with-silverlight.aspx){.broken_link}, and you can watch an interview with him about it in Silverlight. (on a side note, I decided not to include the video into my post, even though the instructions to do so are right there in the original blog entry, because it is set to auto-start when someone visits the page and I think that is just downright rude ðŸ™‚ )

The post is interesting, the video is interesting&#8230; but what is really interesting is the fun going on in the comments on that blog entry, including comments from Mike Downey of Adobe and Scott Barnes of Microsoft&#8230; fun stuff. The old &#8216;if you have nothing nice to say&#8230;&#8217; rule probably should have been applied for both of them.
