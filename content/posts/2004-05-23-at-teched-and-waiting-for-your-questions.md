Headed over to registration today, very very busy&#8230; then to the Cabana with <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/eporter/archive/2004/05/23/139838.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Erik Porter</a>&#8230; very very empty&#8230;. Erik and I then decided to head off to catch a pre-conference session, but even those were backed up due to the long registration lines. Oh well, back to the Cabana to wait for some great VB questions ðŸ™‚
