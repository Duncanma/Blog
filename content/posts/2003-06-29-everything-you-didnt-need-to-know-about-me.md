Is now up on the web (I guess it was all up there before, just not in one place) as my interview with [mainfunction.com](http://students.mainfunction.com/Home/) has made it up onto their web site. I think they told me this was coming months ago, so I hope I didn&#8217;t mention it to a bunch of people then, because I&#8217;m betting it was only published recently.
