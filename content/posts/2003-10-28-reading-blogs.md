I&#8217;ve been catching up on a few blogs, now that I&#8217;ve **finally** managed to get connected ðŸ™‚ &#8230; 

and I just have one comment (meant in the spirit of helpfulness only) &#8230; It is &#8220;ClickOnce&#8221; not &#8220;OneClick&#8221;

Anyway, check out [my article on ClickOnce](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnwinforms/html/clickonce.asp) if you are interested, but watch the name or people might think you are talking about ordering books online&#8230;
