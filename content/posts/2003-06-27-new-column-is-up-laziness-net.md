My most recent [Coding 4 Fun column](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun06272003.asp) was just published&#8230; a fairly &#8220;fun&#8221; example, even if it happens to do something a little &#8216;odd&#8217; with Remoting over SOAP. For those of you who read it; using Add Web Reference on the .NET Compact Framework side of things to connect to a Remoting server is **not** the recommended way to do things, but it does work in some situations and &#8230; well&#8230; it is pretty darn easy, so I went with it. 

Keep in mind the column is called &#8220;Coding 4 Fun&#8221; not &#8220;Enterprise Architecture Best Practices&#8221;, although I try to stick to &#8216;proper&#8217; behaviour most of the time.![](http://help.microsoft.com/!data/en_us/data/messengerv47_xpxchg.its51/$content$/wink_smile.gif)
