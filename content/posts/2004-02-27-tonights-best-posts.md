Forgive me in advance&#8230; I&#8217;m not posting about .NET, in fact I&#8217;m not going to say much at all except to post to two great posts

  * [Chris Sells: Same-Sex Marriages \*Should\* Be Allowed](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=1154){.broken_link}
  * [Harry Pierson: In Support of Gay Marriage](http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=bb2c85ad-794b-46c9-b969-4891333c0702){.broken_link}
and then to a little web-shop that I heard about tonight&#8230; if you are into t-shirts with a message, forget about thinkgeek.com, check this out &#8212; <http://cafeshops.com/getequal>{.broken_link}

In case you are wondering, I&#8217;m certainly adding a +1 to the posts and the shop, but really&#8230; isn&#8217;t that just common sense? To quote a bumper sticker from that online store&#8230; &#8220;Interracial marriage was illegal once too. Let&#8217;s go forward, not backward.&#8221;
