I&#8217;m planning to revamp this page to include &#8216;featured posts&#8217; (selected by me out of all the blogs I get my hands on, not just the ones listed on this page), but here (<http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/support/community/blogs/>{.broken_link}) is the first iteration of that page up on the live site. I&#8217;m interested in feedback, as always, but please hold off on &#8220;Why wasn&#8217;t my blog listed?&#8221;, space was limited in this version but I am planning to expand to additional pages at some point in the future&#8230;. for now I might rotate the blogs mentioned on this page.
