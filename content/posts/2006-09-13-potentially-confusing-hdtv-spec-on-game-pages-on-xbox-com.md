With <a href="http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2006/09/13/Xbox-Live-Arcade-Scramble.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">the release of Scramble today</a>, I noticed something odd on the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/s/scramblexboxlivearcade/default.htm" target="_blank" class="broken_link">game detail page on Xbox.com</a>. Along the&nbsp;left hand side is a listing of the specs of the game (# of players, does it work with Live, etc.) and it includes this interesting line: &#8220;HDTV 480i&#8221;

&nbsp;

Hmm&#8230;. while I&#8217;ve never subscribed to the view that **only** 1080p is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDTV" target="_blank">HDTV</a>, 480i is most certainly not. Yes, it is one of the resolutions that a HDTV monitor can usually display, but if it isn&#8217;t 720p, 1080i or 1080p you can&#8217;t really call it HDTV. Of course, this is probably just a typo&#8230;&nbsp;I believe a 360 game will always be capable of putting out at least 720p, even if it hasn&#8217;t been optimized for that resolution. In fact, several other games list &#8220;HDTV: No Support&#8221; in their specs (<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/t/timepilotxboxlivearcade/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Time Pilot</a> for one), which is certainly not the case.
