My wife read my blog for the first time yesterday, and she has decided that she wants to try it for herself&#8230; but where to blog? dotnetweblogs is great, but this isn&#8217;t going to be a tech-focused blog (is there a mommyblogs.com?). I have my own site, it even runs ASP.NET but I doubt I can do much (if anything at all) with the server config as it is running on a shared server. Is there a good blogging engine that doesn&#8217;t require much on the server end other than file access? Can I use [w.bloggar](http://wbloggar.com/){.broken_link} against it? Hmm&#8230; I need help folks.

It turns out there is a [momblogs.com](http://momblogs.com), but I&#8217;m not sure they actually offer any blog services&#8230;
