Ok, so this is interesting to me, maybe not to everyone. Go to [this page](http://on10.net/blogs/theshow//4181){.broken_link} on on10.net, and notice the lack of CSS&#8230;&nbsp; We are using ASP.NET themes and the CSS for the theme gets inserted as a relative reference (../../../themes etc.) &#8230; well IE does the calculation based off of the URL and doesn&#8217;t find the CSS because the extra slash confuses it.

I went into our code and added a check, if the absolute path of our request contained a double slash, then replace it with a single and redirect. Doesn&#8217;t work, the absolute path never seems to contain a double slash, even when the URL I asked for does. I&#8217;m guessing IIS or ASP.NET is **fixing** things up for me before my http module gets involved&#8230; nice of it, but very annoying in this case.
