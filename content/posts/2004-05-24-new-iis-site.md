I wouldn&#8217;t have known about this site, if the site&#8217;s owner wasn&#8217;t sitting behind me on the plane to TechEd, so I thought the rest of you might not know about it either ðŸ™‚

> <a href="http://www.TryIIS.com" title="IIS" target="_blank" class="broken_link">TryIIS.com</a> is a new site dedicated to resources for evaluating IIS, and contains over 100 whitepapers and other materials&#8230;

Now, I have no idea why they had to create a special site for this, when they have an IIS section of microsoft.com, but that little complaint aside, this site contains a ton of useful info. So&#8230; if you are into web development, you&#8217;ll need a web server and if you are trying to decided between IIS and something else or trying to convince the IT Gods that IIS is the way to go&#8230; this site should be pretty useful for you!
