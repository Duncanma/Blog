We discussed a variety of topics, including the idea of adding a &#8216;user submitted links&#8217; section to MSDN that functions somewhat like what <a href="http://www.asp.net" target="_blank">http://www.asp.net</a> has on the home page (a list of resources that have been submitted by anyone who cares to do so, and then approved by a small body of insiders). What do you think of this idea?
