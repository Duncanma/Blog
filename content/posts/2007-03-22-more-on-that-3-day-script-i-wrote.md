Darn script removing code on AOL! One woman, Nicolle, has <a href="http://journals.aol.com/knowwriter/AmazingAdventures" target="_blank" class="broken_link">a blog with AOL</a>, but it won&#8217;t let her add script to any part of the UI&#8230; or even into a post.

The only way I could think of to try to work out a way around the problem was to make myself an AOL screen name and then an AOL blog and try to do the customizing myself&#8230; no go, they don&#8217;t strip all script tags, but they only allow script tags that are pointing back at certain sites (such as AOL, I&#8217;m assuming).

Any way, it was no go for Nicolle&#8230; but here is <a href="http://www.the3day.org/Arizona07/nicollehoward" target="_blank" class="broken_link">her donation info</a> for the walk in Arizona&#8230; that will be a hot three days!!
