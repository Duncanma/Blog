I flew down to TechEd today, and I made it to the Marriott without any incidents&#8230; and I have my first &#8216;Cabana&#8217; session tomorrow at 8:30 am&#8230; This means I&#8217;ll be hanging out in the convention center, in the &#8216;Cabana&#8217; area, in case anyone wants to drop by and chat about VB&#8230; there will be someone there for all the major technology areas pretty much all the time throughout the week. I&#8217;ve got quite a few shifts scheduled, which means that the Cabanas will be the best place to find me at almost anytime during the event&#8230;

Internet works fine in the hotel rooms by the way, it is a bit slow but the front desk told me (and other folks checking in at the same time) that it wasn&#8217;t working&#8230; for all I know it will stop at any moment, but I would suggest just trying it out anyway, even if the hotel staff tell you that you would be better off sticking to dial-up for now.
