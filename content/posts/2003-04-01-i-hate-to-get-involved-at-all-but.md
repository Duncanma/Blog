  <font face="Trebuchet MS"><br /> <font color="teal">There have been a few VB vs C# debates flying around&#8230; I&#8217;ll refrain<br /> from linking to them all, as they aren’t really saying anything new.

We are a huge campus full of C++<br /> developers. If we did standardize on anything, I would expect it to be Managed<br /> C++.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Also, it’s worth pointing out<br /> that we do development in VB as well, including some of our internal business<br /> applications.<o:p></o:p></font></font>

  <font face="Trebuchet MS"><font color="teal">Before .NET, Microsoft used C++ almost exclusively (and we still do<br /> almost everything in C++) but that doesn&#8217;t mean that everyone should use C++ to<br /> build their line of business applications. People also point out that much of<br /> the Framework was written in C#, but remember, it was written by C++ developers.<br /> There isn’t a single class, method, property, or event, anywhere in the<br /> Framework, that you can’t use from VB.NET. If someone builds a library in C#<br /> that you can&#8217;t use from VB.NET, (and vice versa) they probably did it wrong&#8230;<br /> <o:p></o:p></font></font>

  <font face="Trebuchet MS"><font color="teal">C# is the flashy new language that has arrived with .NET so it gets a<br /> lot of attention (which led to more samples being written in C#, etc&#8230;), but<br /> Visual Basic is by far the more popular language and I don&#8217;t expect that to<br /> change. I write code in Visual Basic everyday and nothing in the Framework is<br /> being &#8220;hidden&#8221; from me, I have full access to the Framework in all its glory. I<br /> don&#8217;t think there is any need to ignore C#, but you certainly don&#8217;t have to<br /> learn it to work in .NET&#8230; <o:p></o:p></font></font>
