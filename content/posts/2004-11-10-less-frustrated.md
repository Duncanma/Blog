I love the internet for one main reason&#8230;. <a href="http://www.suicidegirls.com/" target="_blank">porn</a>. Or is the fact that everyone is willing to help you when you have a problem?

Oh yeah, it is that second one.

I <a href="http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2004/11/08/870.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">posted recently about my frustrating experiences</a> with trying to create a CSS based site layout for <a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/" target="_blank">my site</a>, and a bunch of people chimed in to help me out. Well, with their help, and after reading some of the <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/negativemargins" target="_blank">articles</a> on A List Apart, I was able to get a very basic layout working in both IE and Firefox&#8230; although it doesn&#8217;t currently work in Opera, which surprised me a bit&#8230;

Anyway, thanks to everyone for all the help!
