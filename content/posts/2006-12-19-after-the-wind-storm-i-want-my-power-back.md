It&#8217;s been a few days since the big storm blew through, but I&#8217;m still without power (I&#8217;m at Microsoft now, so I can get connected and charge a few things)&#8230; which sucks when you have kids (and visitors, my in-laws arrived on the night of the storm). We aren&#8217;t too cold now, we&#8217;ve borrowed a propane heater from a friend and we have a gas stove to boil water on for coffee/tea (and to boil hotdogs with!).

No damage to our house, but the big tree across the street managed to clip a house on the way down and tear a hole in it&#8217;s roof. Fun stuff.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/54156810@N00/sets/72157594423999231/" target="_blank">Lots of photos on Flickr about this&#8230;</a>

Right now, I just want power&#8230; the majority of folks in the Puget Sound have power back, but our area is listed as &#8216;one of the most severely damaged&#8217; and we aren&#8217;t expected to have power restored for another 3 to 5 days. The kids are holding up great, but on today, day 4 without power, the adults are becoming quite testy&#8230;

I&#8217;m holding onto hope that power will snap back on before the estimated times they&#8217;ve given us, assuming those times are &#8216;worst case&#8217; guesses. Of course, the kids are safe and warm under the blankets at home&#8230; I&#8217;m at the office with the Starbucks iCup in full working order&#8230; things aren&#8217;t really too bad.
