Not that it affects you, the reader, all that much&#8230; but I&#8217;m getting around 9000 spam comments a day now. It is crazy. I&#8217;d add code to avoid them, but I&#8217;m just finishing up a move to some new blog software that Adam and I wrote (you can see it running on <a href="http://www.adamkinney.com/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Adam&#8217;s site already</a>) and I don&#8217;t really want to spend any more time in the .Text code base&#8230;
