Writing [my last post](http://weblogs.asp.net/duncanma/archive/2004/02/20/77513.aspx){.broken_link} started me thinking about the **C64**&#8230; and I found [this page](http://uk.geocities.com/magoos_universe/64_intro.htm){.broken_link} detailing software releases over the years the C64 was hot (really, it was&#8230;)

I can remember PaperClip was my word processor, Bard&#8217;s Tale I and II were my pastime&#8230;. and Gary Kitchen&#8217;s Game Construction Kit was my hobby&#8230; yep, very cool stuff. And to think, I don&#8217;t have it anymore&#8230; hmm&#8230; I should go fire up the Intellivision.
