Now, it is helping **me** to find things! The [blog page on my personal site](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/blog/default.aspx){.broken_link} has become stuck in DVI/HDTV/Component Video land after one of my posts, all of the ads are about HDTV related stuff&#8230; but, [this](http://www.inday.com/rgb4x/rgb4x.htm){.broken_link} just appeared and it looks pretty cool. Not the most visually appealing device, but I&#8217;m thinking that it could be hidden away and just controlled by a IR emitter&#8230;
