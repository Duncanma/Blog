[Cory Smith posted](http://addressof.com/blog/posts/272.aspx) about an upcoming session at the [Fort Worth .NET Users Group](http://www.fwdnug.org/){.broken_link}, [G. Andrew Duthie talking about ASP.NET (November 18th)](http://weblogs.asp.net/gad/posts/36737.aspx)&#8230; this sounds to me like a PDC-quality session, for free and with a lot more time for audience interaction.

If you are in that part of the country, and you are interested in ASP.NET, you should make some time to head on over.

If you are looking for a user group in your own area, check out [INETA](http://ineta.org/){.broken_link}.
