<font face="Trebuchet MS" color="teal">and they raised a<br /> good question, why would I (I&#8217;m MSDN&#8217;s &#8220;Content Strategist&#8221; for VB, and an<br /> affirmed VB Lover) have C# code on my blog?</font> 

<font face="Trebuchet MS" color="teal">It isn&#8217;t by choice,<br /> that is for sure! It is his fault: <img alt="Matt [Mr. Web Services] Powell" hspace="0" src="http://msdn.microsoft.com/columns/graphics/service.gif" align="baseline" border="0" /></font> 

<font face="Trebuchet MS" color="teal">I&#8217;m doing a little bit of work on some<br /> internal utilities at MSDN and while some of them are in VB.NET, this particular<br /> one was written by that crazy <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/columns/service.asp" class="broken_link">Matt Powell </a>fellow and<br /> it is all in C#. I&#8217;ve actually managed to break a few things out into their own<br /> assemblies and do them in VB.NET, but for the most part the UI is all in C#&#8230;<br /> what is a guy to do? I&#8217;ll try to avoid starting a religous debate here, but I<br /> have to at least say that the C# editor sucks compared to the VB.NET one&#8230; XML<br /> commenting aside! I&#8217;ve heard it is much closer in features to VB.NET in VS.NET<br /> 2003, but I haven&#8217;t done anything but VB.NET in that version of VS.NET, so I<br /> don&#8217;t really know&#8230;</font>

<font face="Trebuchet MS" color="#008080">Sadly, after only a few days of<br /> working on this system, I started adding semicolons to my VB.NET code&#8230; Is that<br /> like calling your wife by the wrong name?</font>
