Yesterday <a href="http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2006/01/16/3548.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">I posted about the use of the feed icon</a> on <a href="http://blog.mediacentersandbox.com/" title="Media Center Sandbox" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Media Center Sandbox</a> and suggested a few changes. Last night, I get an email from <a href="http://blog.retrosight.com/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Charlie Owen</a>, one of the principals of the sandbox site, and the site is completely updated. Now, I don&#8217;t know if I caused any change or if the change was just in the works anyway&#8230;. but regardless, I like the new look and the <a href="http://www.feedicons.com" title="Site about the feed icon" target="_blank">icons</a> look great!
