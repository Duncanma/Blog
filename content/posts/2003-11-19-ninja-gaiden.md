I just read the description of this game on [xbox.com](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/ninjagaiden/default.htm){.broken_link}, which I&#8217;ve done before &#8230; then I read &#8220;Nov 2003&#8221; for a ship date. I swear I actually shivered&#8230; oooh. 

Turns out, according to EBGames.com at least, that it is 12/15/2003&#8230; which is the day before I go away from my XBox for 3 weeks&#8230; but I&#8217;m still excited!
