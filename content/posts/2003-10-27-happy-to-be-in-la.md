Arrived last night, which is sooner than some will be showing up, after flying to Palm Springs and driving up&#8230; which worked out quite well. A few moments after arriving, and getting hooked up to the Internet&#8230; I put up [this letter](http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc/letter.aspx) onto the PDC site, just giving a few helpful bits of info for those of you who arrived late or still haven&#8217;t arrived.

Now, I&#8217;m late for the keynote, but I&#8217;m here and I&#8217;m ready to go!
