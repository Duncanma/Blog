In many ways, I&#8217;m ok with that; it isn&#8217;t like they took away the book when they made the movie&#8230;

**LOTR** is one of the few exceptions in recent times, although I also enjoyed **Timeline** (forgive me)&#8230; **Bourne Identity** might have been a good movie, I can&#8217;t say&nbsp;because having read the book coloured my view of it too much to handle the changes&#8230; I could go on, listing off a variety of movies where I loved the book but found the movie lacking, but that isn&#8217;t the point of this post.

Last night I saw a trailer for &#8220;I, Robot&#8221;.

If you&#8217;ve seen the trailer and you&#8217;ve read the book(s) then you&#8217;ll understand these comments without any more explanation. _What soulless person owns that book license and saw fit to sell it without any concern for what type of movie was produced?_ Wasn&#8217;t there a way to turn this into a box office action flick without going completely against the basic concepts of Asimov&#8217;s robot stories?

Perhaps I should wait until I see the movie before I pass judgement, but isn&#8217;t going to the movie and giving them my money already saying that I think the movie is worth something?

The sad part, to me, is that I was so excited when I saw the first posters&#8230;
