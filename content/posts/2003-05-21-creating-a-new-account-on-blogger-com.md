In [an earlier post](http://dotnetweblogs.com/duncanma/posts/7167.aspx){.broken_link}, I mentioned wanting to create a blog for my wife&#8230; and based on a variety of great feedback through email and comments I decided to create an account on [blogger.com](http://www.blogger.com), but I can&#8217;t get it to work! I&#8217;m not sure what I&#8217;m doing wrong, and they don&#8217;t provide anyway to contact them&#8230; but I keep getting an error that the username is taken and I&#8217;ve tried so many possiblities, including adding random numbers to the end of the name &#8230; I&#8217;ve stopped believing that the username really is taken and instead I think they are just having some other type of problem! 

Yeesh.
