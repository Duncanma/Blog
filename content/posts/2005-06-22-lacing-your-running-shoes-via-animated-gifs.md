When my brother took me to buy running shoes a few years ago, he made a point of showing me a couple of ways to lace them up based on the fit I needed&#8230; but over time I forgot, and now I have new shoes&#8230; luckily for me, the web saves the day (like usual) and I found this on the new balance site: <a href="http://www.newbalance.com/productbrowser/performance/lacing_for_a_better_fit.html?sport=Running&gender=&product_type=&feature=" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Lacing for Better Fit</a>
