A few people have emailed to let me know about the various &#8216;conga lines&#8217; out there, for people interested in the referral based offers <a href="http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2005/01/12/985.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">discussed in my previous post</a>. One source for these, that I know of, is <a href="http://www.gearlive.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=18&#038;sid=4860d5ca207ebcace9dc8ba2d8cbbb59" target="_blank">a forum on GearLive</a> that lists a few different ones.

I guess it isn&#8217;t surprising that these things exist, someone created a difficult to follow process, so trust the gadget geeks to quickly try to &#8216;automate&#8217; it ðŸ™‚
