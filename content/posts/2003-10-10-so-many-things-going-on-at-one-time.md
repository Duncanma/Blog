It has been one of those days&#8230; so much content being worked on, almost none of it visible on MSDN yet&#8230; but it is coming!

If you were watching closely (and I didn&#8217;t expect you to be), you&#8217;ll have noticed some subtle changes on the Dev Centers&#8230; my pic went up onto <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic" target="_blank">http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic</a>, I created a new books page at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/using/books" target="_blank" class="broken_link">http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/using/books</a> and there are quite a few changes coming for the C# Developer Center as well&#8230;
