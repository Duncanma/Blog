As per the blog entry &#8220;[Feed icons](http://blogs.msdn.com/justsean/archive/2005/12/30/508181.aspx "Microsoft WebBlogs"){.broken_link}&#8221; and using icons pulled from the new <a href="http://www.feedicons.com" target="_blank">feedicons</a> site. Hopefully <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com" target="_blank">MSDN</a> will follow suit as well, which would probably be pretty easy&#8230; it looks like they are mostly linking every instance of the &#8216;old&#8217; RSS icon to the same graphic. I&#8217;ll suggest it and we&#8217;ll see what happens.
