As some folks may know, [I](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/letters){.broken_link} come up with the content for the Visual Basic developer center on MSDN (<http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic>) and I&#8217;m going to list some blogs on a sub-page of the site&#8230; starting with a small list, but hopefully growing it with some feedback from the community at large. I&#8217;m interested in blogs that contain useful information for Visual Basic (.NET or not) developers. I was going to start with:

  * [Paul Vick](http://www.panopticoncentral.net) 
  * [3 Leaf (Early & Adopter)](http://radio.weblogs.com/0117167/){.broken_link} 
  * [Brad Abrams](http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/BradA/){.broken_link} 
  * [ShowUsYourCode](http://weblogs.asp.net/dneimke/) 
  * [Chris Brumme](http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/cbrumme/){.broken_link} 
  * Whoops, forgot [Keith Pleas](http://weblogs.asp.net/kpleas/) on my clipboard ðŸ™‚ 
  * Likely [weblogs.asp.net](http://weblogs.asp.net) and [blogs.gotdotnet.com](http://blogs.gotdotnet.com){.broken_link} in general 

Although this is **not** intended to be a complete list of all useful blogs&#8230; (that would quickly become unusable as a page on the site), but if you have any suggestions for blogs to list on the VB developer center (or comments on the ones I have listed), please let me know!
