If you&#8217;ve written an app, private or public, using [my data feed of Xbox live info](http://duncanmackenzie.net/blog/put-up-a-rest-api-for-xbox-gamertag-data/default.aspx){.broken_link} I&#8217;d really appreciate it if you&#8217;d let me know. This isn&#8217;t a required &#8216;sign-up&#8217;, but I want to start to keep track so that I could possibly create a page listing all the sites using it, and it may also be useful to be able to contact folks if I need to make a change or take the service down for an hour or so. Just comment on this post, or drop me a line at <duncanma@microsoft.com>.
