I had no idea this was possible, but has anyone managed to either:

  1. Pull video off of their Motorola HD DVR cable box onto XP/Vista?
  2. Hook up the DVR using Firewire to a Media Center Edition box?

I&#8217;m currently using a IR Blaster and the standard definition outputs on the Motorola box to connect my cable box to my MCE 2005 XP box&#8230; works, but the quality isn&#8217;t great&#8230; but then I found <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~timmmoore/firewire/readme.htm" target="_blank" class="broken_link">this guide to firewire connections</a>
