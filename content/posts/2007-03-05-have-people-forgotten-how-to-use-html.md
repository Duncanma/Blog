This keeps happening to me on Microsoft sites, and it really bugs me&#8230;

  * I go to view a product on one of our sites, <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/viewer.aspx?productId=992&assetTypeId=1&shotId=0" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Xbox.com</a> and <a href="http://www.zune.net/en-us/accessories/zune/mediaviewers/mv-homeavpack.htm" target="_blank">Zune.net</a> most recently
  * I click on some image to see a larger view&#8230;
  * I right-click on the image with the intent of saving it to my machine, only to get the standard Flash context menu (Zoom, etc&#8230;)

I get the appeal of Flash, I really do&#8230; but these pages are just a gallery of images with a back and next button. There is no smooth animation between images, the images aren&#8217;t interactive or animated, this is just 3-10 jpeg images that I can move between. By using Flash, I lose the ability to interact with these images in the way that HTML would have provided, and I can&#8217;t see what I&#8217;ve gained!

It is completely within the capabilities of HTML combined with Javascript to make an image gallery with this level of functionality, and shouldn&#8217;t we try to stick to that level of technology whenever possible?
