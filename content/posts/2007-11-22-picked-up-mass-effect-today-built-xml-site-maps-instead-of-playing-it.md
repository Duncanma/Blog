I&#8217;m very excited about it&#8230; really! I just got distracted on <http://sitemaps.org> and ended up building [a site map for this site](http://duncanmackenzie.net/Sitemap.ashx){.broken_link}&#8230; real brute force, just grabbed all the blog entries and tags and output the appropriate absolute paths into some objects that I then wrote out into an XML document. Same method wouldn&#8217;t work on [Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com) though, it has too many entries, so I&#8217;ll need to move to a site map index with multiple sub site maps&#8230; now I just have to figure out how to divide the entries up (by tag, by type of content, by date?).
