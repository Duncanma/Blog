I&#8217;ve often had email exchanges and thought about posting them as blog entries&#8230; and now I&#8217;ve seen someone do it&#8230; and I have to say that it is a little hard to read (for the email part, start at the bottom and read up&#8230; which is normal for email, but not intuitive in a blog posting)&#8230; That difficulty is worth going through though because if you read the entire post you&#8217;ll find out lots of useful info&#8230; ðŸ™‚
