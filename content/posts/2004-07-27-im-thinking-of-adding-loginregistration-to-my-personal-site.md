Not sure what scenarios this will be used to enable in the long run, but I might play around with some web services (with authentication) and a few &#8216;prototypes&#8217; for articles and MSDN features that I&#8217;ve been musing about&#8230; 

  * Do you run a personal site?
  * Do you have any form of authentication?
  * What do you use to handle it (I&#8217;m planning Forms Authentication against SQL Server)?
  * What do you use it for?

this is for <http://www.duncanmackenzie.net>&nbsp;&#8230; which is quickly becoming my little sandbox for asp.net code ðŸ™‚
