Lately I&#8217;ve been luckily enough to be able to reuse several bits of code I&#8217;ve written in Visual Basic 2002 and 2003, namely code from a few of my earlier MSDN articles (<a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/pull.aspx?pageToPull=http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/?url=/library/en-us/dndotnet/html/designsurface.asp" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Design Surface</a> and <a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/pull.aspx?pageToPull=http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwinforms/html/custcntrlsampover.asp" target="_blank" class="broken_link">the Control series</a>). Since I was planning to make a few changes, I pulled these projects into Visual Basic 2005 Beta 1 (instead of just referencing the already existing assemblies created with the .NET Framework 1.0/1.1). I also was in the midst of writing a new control for an upcoming MSDN magazine article, that I was also planning to use in my &#8216;real&#8217; work, so I pulled the finished code (written in VB.NET 2003) into VB 2005&#8230; In every case, every single thing worked fine without any changes except for the same reoccuring issue;

I have a habit of accessing shared members off of instances, sometimes without even realizing it. Well, this &#8216;feature&#8217; is no longer possible in VB 2005. The IDE will pick up on every place you&#8217;ve done this in your code, and it is very easy to fix, but each and every one of my projects opened from VB.NET 2002/2003 has come up with a few of these errors.

The most common culprits (for me)? Using Me.MousePosition() off of a Form instance, when this is really <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemwindowsformscontrolclassmousepositiontopic.asp" target="_blank">a Shared member of the Control class</a>, and using the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemarrayclasscopytopic.asp" target="_blank">.Copy method of an array</a> off of the array variable instead of off of System.Array. For the first issue, a quick change from Me.MousePosition to Control.MousePosition and that problem is gone, and for the second I just have to replace the array variable name with System.Array&#8230; so it isn&#8217;t a difficult fix in either case.

The best part of this experience is that just knowing about this change in VB 2005, will (hopefully) change the way I code in VB.NET 2003, which is probably a good thing considering everything Paul points out in <a href="http://panopticoncentral.net/archive/2003/08/07/172.aspx" target="_blank">his post on the topic</a>.
