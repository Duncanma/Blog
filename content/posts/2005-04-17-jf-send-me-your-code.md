jf has been having issues with [my control](http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2005/04/15/1321.aspx){.broken_link}, and I have no idea why&#8230; if it will help, him or anyone else, there is the original version of the code and a test form available for download <a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/samples/#divider" target="_blank" class="broken_link">here</a>

Now, for jf specifically&#8230; feel free to email me your code and maybe I can see why it isn&#8217;t working for you, thanks!
