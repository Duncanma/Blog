If you found a (really) cool download on MSDN, but it was 200+ mb, would you want it packaged for download as a single file, or as multiple .cabs (maybe 10-20 mb each?) 

Of course, this isn&#8217;t just hypothetical, but details on what the download is will follow in a few days!

Post comments if you have the time!

Thanks!
