Robert posted [some good info](http://weblogs.asp.net/rmclaws/posts/32898.aspx) about the new changes in [GotDotNet Workspaces](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/default.aspx){.broken_link}, and it was compelling enough that I went out and added aliases for my various workspaces!



  * Visual Studio .NET Bootstrapper Plug-In is now <http://workspaces.gotdotnet.com/vsBoot>{.broken_link}
  * My Music System is now <http://workspaces.gotdotnet.com/musicxp>{.broken_link}
  * The File System Objects workspace is <http://workspaces.gotdotnet.com/fso>{.broken_link}
  * and my stagnant API Viewer workspace is <http://workspaces.gotdotnet.com/apiview>{.broken_link}
