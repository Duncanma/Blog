So, if you missed it&#8230; I was just playing with displaying a poll in the blog&#8230; don&#8217;t worry, I won&#8217;t make a habit of this :)&#8230; I did it using <strike>the spawn of evil</strike> an iframe&#8230; I&#8217;ve removed it now, the experiment is done&#8230; but it exposed an interesting problem. When viewed through the IFRAME IE&#8217;s default settings (well, my settings&#8230; I&#8217;m not sure if they are the default) blocked any cookies from that page, which meant that you could vote as often as you liked&#8230; hmm&#8230; not a good thing. Obviously a second-line of defense is necessary.
