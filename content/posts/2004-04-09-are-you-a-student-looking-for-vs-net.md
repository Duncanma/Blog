Make sure you check out your University/College bookstore! &#8220;vbjay&#8221; [mentioned today (on GotDotNet)](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/MessageBoard/Thread.aspx?id=212215&Page=1#212615){.broken_link} that he bought [the Academic version of VS.NET 2003](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/productinfo/overview/academic/features/) from his college bookstore for just a bit over $100.00. I did some googling around and found several University bookstores offering the software for around 99 dollars (to current students and staff only in most cases). If you have an academic reseller nearby, and you qualify to purchase VS.NET from them, make sure you check it out.
