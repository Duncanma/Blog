80 now I think, after a quick bit of [Ridge Racer](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/r/ridgeracer6/){.broken_link}&#8230;. but an overall low score. I&#8217;m told that I need to just play more games, but we&#8217;ll see how I do with my current set of&nbsp; PDZ, PGR3,DOA4 and&nbsp;Ridge Racer. Ridge Racer is a really different racing experience than PGR3, where I&#8217;ve been spending most of my time&#8230; not sure if I like it yet, but I&#8217;ll give it a bit of time, that&#8217;s the whole reason I get these games through GameFly &#8230; try before you buy.
