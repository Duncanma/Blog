I&#8217;m part of a dev team that builds blog/forum software and I&#8217;ve been thinking about mobile interfaces lately&#8230; so I&#8217;m trying to find a good example of site like ours that provides a good (enjoyable, useful and usable) mobile interface&#8230; one that will work across a variety of browses. It seems 37 Signals is thinking about the same thing these days and they&#8217;ve made a blog post looking for exactly the same thing I am, [examples of good mobile interfaces](http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/745-link-it-up-mobile-web-app-interfaces). I&#8217;m looking for sites that are some combination of text and video blogging and are usable via a relatively modern phone. I found a lot of the comments to that post to be completely unhelpful&#8230; because they were focused on sites that are specific to the iPhone! Building an interface for the iPhone is not a bad idea, but I certainly wouldn&#8217;t try to do that until after we had a good general purpose interface for a much wider variety of mobile devices. I did find a few interesting sites though, from the comments and from another site (Brian Cantoni&#8217;s list of good mobile sites at [http://cantoni.mobi/](http://cantoni.mobi/ "http://cantoni.mobi/")): 

  * [http://mobile.seriouseats.com/](http://mobile.seriouseats.com/ "http://mobile.seriouseats.com/") 
      * [http://news.bbc.co.uk/text_only.stm](http://news.bbc.co.uk/text_only.stm "http://news.bbc.co.uk/text_only.stm") 
          * [http://bbcriver.com/](http://bbcriver.com/ "http://bbcriver.com/"){.broken_link} (seems like it would benefit from some paging, but I could be wrong&#8230; is one big page better on a phone than paging?) 
              * [http://m.joystiq.com/](http://m.joystiq.com/ "http://m.joystiq.com/")</ul> 
            &nbsp;
            
            Of course, all of these map well to the home page of our site(s) (like [on10.net](http://on10.net/){.broken_link} or [Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com)), I wonder if there are any good examples for a web forum? I&#8217;m pretty sure that a lot of our users would like to be able to view [Channel 9&#8217;s Coffeehouse](http://channel9.msdn.com/Showforum.aspx?forumid=15){.broken_link} on their mobile device, and off hand I don&#8217;t know what the ideal experience for that would be.
