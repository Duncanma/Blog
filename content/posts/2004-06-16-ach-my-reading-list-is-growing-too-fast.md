Just today, I&#8217;ve added the new [&#8220;Smart Client Offline Application Block&#8221;](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnpag/html/offline.asp) (from PAG), [FotoVision](http://msdn.microsoft.com/smartclient/codesamples/fotovision/){.broken_link}, these [articles by Cliff Atkinson about PowerPoint](http://www.sociablemedia.com/articles_list.htm){.broken_link}&#8230; and I brought home Murach&#8217;s [&#8220;ASP.NET Web Programming with VB.NET&#8221;](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1890774200/duncanmackenz-20?creative=125581&camp=2321&link_code=as1) to start reading _in my spare time&#8230;_ While all of these things, and especially that book, look great&#8230; adding 3 or 4 things a day without any scheduled time to work at reducing the list, just isn&#8217;t going to scale&#8230;

On the bright side, I don&#8217;t think folks in our business are facing any real **shortage** of great information these days.
