I&#8217;ve recently begun re-reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katharine_Kerr" target="_blank">the Deverry novels</a>; I just went through [Daggerspell](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553565214?ie=UTF8&tag=duncanmackenz-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0553565214)<img style="border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none; margin: 0px; border-left: medium none; border-bottom: medium none" height="1" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=duncanmackenz-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0553565214" width="1" border="0" />, [Darkspell](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553568884?ie=UTF8&tag=duncanmackenz-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0553568884) <img style="border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none; margin: 0px; border-left: medium none; border-bottom: medium none" height="1" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=duncanmackenz-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0553568884" width="1" border="0" />and I&#8217;m onto [The Bristling Wood](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553285815?ie=UTF8&tag=duncanmackenz-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0553285815) <img style="border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none; margin: 0px; border-left: medium none; border-bottom: medium none" height="1" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=duncanmackenz-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0553285815" width="1" border="0" />(basically &#8216;Act 1&#8217; as the author has described the books as being the various parts of a long play). This is an excellent series, but one that I found quite by accident. 

Back when I was a fairly young kid, maybe 12 or 13, a friend of my mother was visting our house and upon realizing that I read the same type of books as him, offered to trade his set of books by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Eddings" target="_blank">David Eddings</a> for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deryni_novels" target="_blank">my &#8216;Deryni&#8217; series by Katherine Kurtz</a>. Now I read my books over and over again, so I didn&#8217;t understand what he meant&#8230; it seems perfectly logical to most folks that since we had both read our books once, this was a permanent trade, but I was quite surprised when I eventually figured that out. Of course, I could have just asked for my books back, but that didn&#8217;t seem appropriate and I certainly had enjoyed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Belgariad" target="_blank">Belgariad</a> (although the second set of books by Mr. Eddings seemed way too much of a retelling of the first&#8230; right down to the same characters&#8230; sure they were the descendants of the first set, but really&#8230; would they all end up with roughly the same personalites?). Anyway, I&#8217;ve always wanted to pick up [the Deryni series](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345326784?ie=UTF8&tag=duncanmackenz-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0345326784) <img style="border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none; margin: 0px; border-left: medium none; border-bottom: medium none" height="1" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=duncanmackenz-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0345326784" width="1" border="0" />again so I tend to look for them in bargain bins at bookstores and the like. Well, when I thought I had discovered a whole new series by the same person I immediately bought the first four books in the Deverry series. Of course, it was not the same person at all, Kerr instead of Kurtz, but I didn&#8217;t figure that out right away. So, I ended up reading a great series of books completely by accident.

How do you decide what to read? As a kid, I used to pick up the first book in a ton of new series and decided which ones&nbsp;I liked from there, but now (with the notable exception of Robert Jordan&#8217;s series) I haven&#8217;t picked up a book by a new-to-me author in ages. I know I could just go and grab some recent books from the library, but are there any good/great blogs/sites focused on the fantasy genre?
