[Paul Vick](http://www.panopticoncentral.net/), language guy for Visual Basic and unofficial spokesman for Krispy Kreme (look at the picture to understand that comment), arrived yesterday at TechEd&#8230;. Look for him around the Developer Division Cabanas (5 and 6), the Visual Studio 2005 booth and at the &#8220;Meet the VB Team&#8221; session (Thursday 3:15-4:30).
