I've obviously been busy, I never even posted a link to these articles here... I've written two new Xbox Dad article in the past few weeks, [one all about Xbox Live](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/liveis5ive/xboxdad.htm) (to coincide with the [Xbox Live is Five](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/liveis5ive) event going on) and [one that I wrote this week about Viva Piñata Party Animals](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/personality/xboxdad/2007/1121-vivapartyanimals.htm).

[Viva Piñata Party](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/splash/v/vivapinatapartyanimals/) is a great game, the &#8216;party' nature of it means that it is quick to get started, even for non-gamers, and the quick little matches means that you can pick it up and play even if you only have a little bit of time available.
