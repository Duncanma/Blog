Ok, so any action you take against your database is your own responsibility&#8230; so this is my fault, but I&#8217;m still _miffed_.

I installed the new drop of the <a href="http://www.telligentsystems.com/Solutions/Forums/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Forums code from Rob Howard and co&#8230;</a> and one of the various bits of information I picked up from the support forum and the docs was that I could happily install this onto an existing database because (quoting from the readme here)&#8230; &#8220;All the objects in the Forums product use the forums_ prefix so there shouldn&#8217;t be any problem&#8221; . Whoops, guess they made a small mistake there, it should have been **most of the objects use the forums_ prefix**&#8230; their sql scripts happily drop any existing table named &#8220;Vote&#8221;&#8230; killing <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/using/columns/code4fun/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun08032004.asp" target="_blank" class="broken_link">the vote table for my online polls</a>&#8230; including all of the votes that had occured since my last export&#8230; ouch.

Now, as I said earlier, this is all my fault&#8230; I looked at a bit of the sql script and decided to trust the docs&#8230; which is a bit silly when it involves my own data&#8230; but perhaps learning about my folly will remind you to read any installation sql scripts carefully, even when they&#8217;ve been documented as safe&#8230;
