<a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/blog/laura-is-going-to-do-the-breast-cancer-3-day-walk/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">My wife is going to be in the 3-Day walk for Breast Cancer</a> and I thought it might be useful to build a widget to display your donation info on a website. So if you are going to walk in the event, or if you know someone who is, then you might be interested in this.

To get this

Just add this text to your page:

`<script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/ThreeDay.ashx?donationurl=http://www.the3day.org/Seattle07/lauramackenzie"><br /></script>` 

(replace the donation url with the link for the appropriate person&#8230; or leave it as Laura&#8217;s&nbsp;ðŸ™‚ ) 

&nbsp;

Note that I haven&#8217;t tested this with anyone else&#8217;s page, so please let me know how it works for you.
