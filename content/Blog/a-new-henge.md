[SQLServerCentral.com](http://sqlservercentral.com/newsletter/" target="_blank)&#8216;s newsletter included a link to [a newly built ring similar in many ways to Stonehenge](http://www.astronomynz.org.nz/stonehenge/stonehenge.htm" target="_blank)... overall it looks like a really cool project to illustrate how this technology was originally used.
