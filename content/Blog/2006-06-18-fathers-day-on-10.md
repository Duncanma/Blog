We ran <a href="http://on10.net/Blogs/TheShow/3569/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">a father&#8217;s day themed bit on 10 on Friday</a>, but if you are into gadgets you&#8217;ll probably like it regardless of the day. I like the Superman laptop from Alienware, the rather simplistic graphic appeals to me. For the desktops, I believe I liked the <a href="http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2005/05/01/1403.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Star Wars ones</a> better, but they no longer seem to be available. (actually, I couldn&#8217;t find any info about them on the site&#8230; but I tried out <a href="http://www.alienware.com/starwars_pages/awswaurora.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">the old links</a> and they seemed to still work&#8230;) Of course, the most appealing thing is probably the wi-fi finder&#8230; it is a bit more in my price range than the other gadgets&#8230; actually it isn&#8217;t, but the cheaper wi-fi spotters probably are.
