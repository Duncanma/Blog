I love the recently posted ["Enhanced BrowseForFolder styled TreeView"](http://www.codeproject.com/cs/miscctrl/treeviewexplorer.asp){.broken_link} (a C# control by Jerry Maguire), and the list of new content from the last week is just amazing;

  * [A Piano Key Control in C#](http://www.codeproject.com/cs/miscctrl/LesStPianoKey.asp){.broken_link} &#8211; Leslie Sanford (a cool article if you are into control building)
  * [Code Access Security from the perspective of the Developer and Administrator](http://www.codeproject.com/dotnet/casdevadmhtml.asp){.broken_link}
   
    by Benjamin Wootton (brief discussion of a complex, but essential topic for .NET developers
  * [QuickWhere: create complex forms for searching into databases](http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/QuickWhere.asp){.broken_link} by DragD (yes, I know it is in VB.NET, but if you are or ever were into Query-By-Form interfaces, this is an interesting sample)

If you aren't subscribed to Code Project's RSS feed ([here](http://www.codeproject.com/webservices/articlerss.aspx)) or their newsletter ([here](http://www.codeproject.com/script/profile/modify.asp){.broken_link}), you are definitely missing out.
