I have a bunch of writing to do, but what I really want to do is code!

It turns out I have a bunch of coding to do as well&#8230; but the writing is _more overdue_ than the coding (at the moment)!

Of course, I could just say to hell with them both and go play some [SW:KOTOR](http://www.lucasarts.com/products/swkotor), but I finished it a couple of nights ago and I&#8217;m not quite ready to start again&#8230; although the dark path should provide some interesting replay value.

I recently finished the first chapter of a new book quite a bit ahead of schedule. The book isn&#8217;t due out for quite awhile, but I was offered a place on the PDC version of the Whidbey DVD(s) _if I could get it in by last week_, and that was a chance I didn&#8217;t want to miss. Not going to the PDC? Well, don&#8217;t worry&#8230; I&#8217;m sure it will be posted somewhere pretty quick after the event&#8230; and it might even end up on [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic) around the same time&#8230;. hmm&#8230; I think I&#8217;m stalling, I&#8217;d better get back to work.
