> Halo 2 is officially coming to Vista.&nbsp; It is shipping to retailers on May 22nd.&nbsp; I sit down with Jo Clowes from Hired Gun to talk about new features, new maps and what we can expect from Halo 2 on Vista.&nbsp;We bring you all the cool visuals.&nbsp; Jo talks to us about some of the achievements you can earn for both single player and multi-player.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a flaming Ninja achievement you earn through multi-player where you kill three&#8230;.oh, well you&#8217;ll just have to watch the video to find out about that one.&nbsp;

Including footage of me playing through a few moments of the first level&#8230; and even a shot of my gamercard ðŸ™‚
