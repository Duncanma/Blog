While I did manage to find some really nice desktop backgrounds at <http://www.ninjagaidengame.com/NinjaGaiden/images/wallpaper/wallpaper3_1280.html>, I didn&#8217;t find a release date for the game I&#8217;ve been waiting for&#8230; Now, considering who I work for, I&#8217;m not one to talk trash about a company for slipping in their software release schedule, but I was a little surprised in each case (they&#8217;ve slipped more than once on Ninja Gaiden) that I only heard about the slip _after the planned release date had passed._ You&#8217;d think they would see it coming at least a few weeks before hand (here&#8217;s a hint, if the DVDs aren&#8217;t on the trucks, you aren&#8217;t going to release tomorrow).

Ah well, here&#8217;s hoping that the end of this month or beginning of the next becomes the magic date for Tecmo and discs start arriving at a store near you.
