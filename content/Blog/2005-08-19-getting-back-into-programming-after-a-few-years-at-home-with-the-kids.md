A friend of mine, through my wife, has been a stay-at-home mom for the past few years and is trying to get back into the swing of computer programming. It doesn&#8217;t take long to get out of date in the computer industry, so I can understand her desire to flex her _coding muscles_ a bit. Although she could just go back to what she knew before, she has decided to try learning something that is completely new, which I think is a great way to go. Personally I might have suggested C# to someone with her background (C, C++, Assembly), but perhaps I&#8217;m biased ðŸ™‚ &#8230; and I have to admit that her decision to go with Ruby seems pretty cool.

You can visit her blog, <a href="http://rubynewbie.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Confessions of a Ruby Newbie</a>, to follow along with her progress as she gets back into programming and explores Ruby at the same time. If you happen to have gone through a similar experience, getting back into your field after staying at home, I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;d love to know how it went for you!
