I took [the test](http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/JTypes2.asp) Chris has been [talking about](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=796){.broken_link}, ended up as an ENTJ as well&#8230; I didn&#8217;t read the descriptions before or after&#8230; but I think I get the general idea. 

As Chris was saying, I bet we could come up with quite a few similar traits amongst people at Microsoft&#8230; even my son has noticed. Whenever he sees another Microsoft developer (t-shirt, glasses, maybe a little below the peak of physical fitness..) he points at them and says &#8220;Daddy!&#8221; and then giggles while pointing at various guys around the Microsoft campus and saying &#8220;more Daddy, more Daddy&#8221; &#8230; when the well-dressed guys (must be from Marketing&#8230; or maybe the Office group) come walking by, he doesn&#8217;t say a thing.
