I'm slowly getting the TechEd slides up and onto MSDN... [the first few for VB are up here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/community/events/TechEd/), [SQL's are here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/sql/teched)... and more are coming _very soon now_ for C#, C++, ASP.NET and others...


  ([Listening To](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/dotnet/articles/ms973230(v=msdn.10)): The Darkest One [[The Tragically Hip](https://open.spotify.com/search/The%20Tragically%20Hip/artists) / In Violet Light])
