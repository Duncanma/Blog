title: New Column Is Up (Laziness .NET)
type: posts
---
My most recent [Coding 4 Fun column](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun06272003.asp) was just published... a fairly "fun" example, even if it happens to do something a little 'odd' with Remoting over SOAP. For those of you who read it; using Add Web Reference on the .NET Compact Framework side of things to connect to a Remoting server is **not** the recommended way to do things, but it does work in some situations and ... well... it is pretty darn easy, so I went with it.

Keep in mind the column is called "Coding 4 Fun" not "Enterprise Architecture Best Practices", although I try to stick to 'proper' behaviour most of the time.![](https://help.microsoft.com/!data/en_us/data/messengerv47_xpxchg.its51/$content$/wink_smile.gif)
