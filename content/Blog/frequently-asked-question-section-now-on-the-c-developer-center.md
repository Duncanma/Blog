Hey folks, I've been working with the C# Team and two great C# MVPs (Jon Skeet and Nicholas Paldino) to put together a &#8216;live' C# FAQ. This FAQ is being run as a blog, hosted at [http://blogs.msdn.com/csharpfaq](http://blogs.msdn.com/csharpfaq" target="_blank) and is displayed on the C# Developer Center on MSDN (at [http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/team/faq](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/team/faq" target="_blank)).

This list of questions and answers is continually being updated, so if you don't see an answer to your question, and you think it is a common one... please submit it through the ["Ask a FAQ Question"](http://blogs.msdn.com/csharpfaq/archive/2004/03/06/85249.aspx" target="_blank) area of the blog.
