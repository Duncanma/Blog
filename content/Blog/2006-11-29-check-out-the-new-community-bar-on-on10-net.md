One of my jobs over the past couple of weeks has been to build a javascript based &#8216;toolbar&#8217; that could run across the top of on10.net and show folks headlines aggregated from a variety of Microsoft Community sites. So, along with a bunch of help from <a href="http://www.adamkinney.com" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Adam</a> and <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/eporter/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Erik</a>, I managed to get it finished and deployed today. [You can see it on top of the page on 10](http://on10.net){.broken_link}

<a href="http://on10.net" target="_new" atomicselection="true" class="broken_link"><img height="207" src="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/images/WindowsLiveWriter/CheckoutthenewCommunityBaronon10.net_214/CommunityBar%5B4%5D.png" width="340" border="0" /></a> 

If it overlaps with the logo for you, try forcing a refresh using ctrl+f5 in IE&#8230; or just picking reload/refresh in whatever browser you use&#8230; the css had to change to accomodate this new content and the old css often sticks in the cache longer than it should.
