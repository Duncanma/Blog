In a very &#8216;Easter-Egg-ish&#8217; post, [Grant Richins](http://blogs.msdn.com/grantri){.broken_link} (a developer on the C# Compiler Team), explains a configuration option of &#8216;alink.dll&#8217;.

<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p>
    <em>So everybody hopefully knows you can put a star &#8220;*&#8221; for either of the last 2 version numbers of the AssemblyVersion attribute.&nbsp; ALink will then translate that into the days and minutes since January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2000.&nbsp; Well, here comes the feature: What if you don&#8217;t like January 1<sup>st</sup> 2000?&nbsp; Well, you can change it.</em>

Personally, this seems of dubious worth, which might explain the lack of documentation, but if this option is useful to you, [check out his post for all the details](http://blogs.msdn.com/grantri/archive/2004/04/13/112837.aspx){.broken_link}.
