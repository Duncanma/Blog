Hey folks, I&#8217;ve been working with the C# Team and two great C# MVPs (Jon Skeet and Nicholas Paldino) to put together a &#8216;live&#8217; C# FAQ. This FAQ is being run as a blog, hosted at <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/csharpfaq" target="_blank">http://blogs.msdn.com/csharpfaq</a> and is displayed on the C# Developer Center on MSDN (at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/team/faq" target="_blank" class="broken_link">http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/team/faq</a>). 

This list of questions and answers is continually being updated, so if you don&#8217;t see an answer to your question, and you think it is a common one&#8230; please submit it through the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/csharpfaq/archive/2004/03/06/85249.aspx" target="_blank">&#8220;Ask a FAQ Question&#8221;</a> area of the blog.
