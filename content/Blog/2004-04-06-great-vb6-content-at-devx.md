I was browsing DevX&#8217;s Visual Basic Zone (<http://www.devx.com/vb>) and I found so much great stuff I just thought I&#8217;d better point out a couple of useful items;

  * Printing Info for VB6 in two parts ([part 1](http://www.devx.com/getHelpOn/10MinuteSolution/18219) and [part 2](http://www.devx.com/getHelpOn/10MinuteSolution/20103))
  * and I also found <http://www.freevbcode.com/> which has a ton of VB6 code snippets (and is also part of DevX, despite the different URL)

Pretty cool stuff, worth checking out.
