title: Word 2000 VBA (Wrox) Source Code
type: posts
---
A few weeks ago someone emailed Channel 9 looking for me, hoping to track down the source code for an old book of mine ([Word 2000 VBA](http://www.amazon.com/Word-2000-VBA-Programmers-Reference/dp/1861002556/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1310972502&sr=8-2)). At the time I couldn't imagine that I'd be able to find it, but I found a set of archive CDs that I've made over the years and voila, there it was.

Anyway, in the interest of feeding the internet search engine monster, the source code (in a zip) is attached to this post for anyone who might be looking for it. Download it from here: <http://duncanmackenzie.net/Media/Default/BlogPost/Attachment/2556-1.zip>
