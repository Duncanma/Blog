I'm planning to revamp this page to include &#8216;featured posts' (selected by me out of all the blogs I get my hands on, not just the ones listed on this page), but here (<http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/support/community/blogs/>{.broken_link}) is the first iteration of that page up on the live site. I'm interested in feedback, as always, but please hold off on "Why wasn't my blog listed?", space was limited in this version but I am planning to expand to additional pages at some point in the future.... for now I might rotate the blogs mentioned on this page.
