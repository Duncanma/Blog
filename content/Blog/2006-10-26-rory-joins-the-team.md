If you don&#8217;t already know Rory, well&#8230; keep watching <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/" target="_blank">Channel 9</a>&#8230; I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll be hearing more from him through that venue soon.

For now, he has joined us over in the &#8216;dev&#8217; hallway, which I&#8217;m sure he finds quite exciting&#8230; maybe not as exciting as his Microsoft provided &#8216;temp housing&#8217;, but maybe it is close.

It would have provided me a way to fit in and make friends with the neighbors, but alas and alack, such luck was not to be mine. I wasn&#8217;t even provided a gun.&#8221; &#8212; From <a href="http://neopoleon.com/home/blogs/neo/archive/2006/10/19/22315.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Rory&#8217;s moving day post</a>
