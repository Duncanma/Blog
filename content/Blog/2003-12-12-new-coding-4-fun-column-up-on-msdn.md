The latest &#8216;issue&#8217; of my Coding 4 Fun column has been published to MSDN;

> <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/using/columns/code4fun/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun12102003.asp" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Duncan Mackenzie describes how to control a serial-portâ€“connected LCD panel using Microsoft Visual Basic .NET and Microsoft Visual C# .NET.</a>

It is probably worth mentioning that I have hidden a CRC16 class in the code download as well, so even if you aren&#8217;t into hooking up an LCD panel, that CRC stuff might be of use!
