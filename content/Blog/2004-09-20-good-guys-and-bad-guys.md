Everything comes down to that one of those two groups to my son, and he seems to really like that idea (wouldn&#8217;t we all like the world to be that clearly defined). Today he is a bit sick and my wife sent me this message;

> _Connor&#8217;s feeling pretty sick today. He still has a fever. We&#8217;re definitely not going to preschool. I explained to him that the cold is a &#8220;bad guy&#8221;, and that he has good guys in his body that are fighting him. I reasurred him that the good guys outnumbered the bad guys, and that they&#8217;d win, but that he could help by trying to rest today. He seemed to like the idea of the good guys and bad guys._ 

My thought, within moments, was that there has to be a game out there somewhere that shows his body fighting off a cold using imagery that would appeal to a 3.5 yr old. I didn&#8217;t manage to find one, although I did find flash animations about bio-terrorism, AIDS, and more&#8230;
