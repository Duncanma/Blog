Well, I haven&#8217;t produced anything of staggering brillance tonight, but I&#8217;m a little less behind on some of my writing obligations (now those SAMS editors will stop posting my picture in the coffee room with nasty words beneath it)&#8230; still behind on 3 or 4 other projects, but progress is progress&#8230; I&#8217;m not going to complain!

Some very cool stuff coming soon on the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp" target="_blank">Visual C# Developer Center</a>, which I have recently taken over &#8216;stewardship&#8217; of, I&#8217;ll leave it to <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/ericgu/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">someone else</a> to give away details if he wants and just say that if you care at all about the C# language itself, beyond the basics, then you are going to want to spend some time at the developer center in the next while!

On a very unrelated note, I went into a new movie-rental place the other day (new to me that is) and I &#8216;registered&#8217; for an account with their system&#8230; but I didn&#8217;t receive a card, instead the fellow just told me that the last four digits of my phone # were now my account # and that I could just use those to access the account. Hmm&#8230; a GUID would be overkill, but how exactly are the last 4 digits of my phone number sufficient to uniquely identify me? I&#8217;m thinking that he was simplifying the system for me (probably assuming that I, like yourselves, didn&#8217;t want to know the details) and that my real account number was some system generated thing (or at least my full phone #) and they just looked stuff up by the phone #, asking for my name if they received multiple results on the same #&#8230; but who knows&#8230; maybe they are just crossing their fingers and hoping that they won&#8217;t have any conflicts on those last four digits?

_I&#8217;m tempted to go back in and open another account, different phone #, same last 4 digits&#8230; but perhaps some people would find that weird?_
