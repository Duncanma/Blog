I'll be [there](http://makezine.com/faire/" target="_blank) tomorrow with [Laura Foy](http://on10.net/people/laura/" target="_blank) (host) and Scott Finley (expert camera dude).... and I'll be doing... well, it is hard to describe what I'll be doing, but hopefully most of it will be fun!

Check out the program at [http://makezine.com/faire/](http://makezine.com/faire/" target="_blank) and let me know what you would want to go see...
