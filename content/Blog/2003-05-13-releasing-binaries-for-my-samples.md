Since starting my [column](http://msdn.microsoft.com/columns/codefun.asp){.broken_link}, I&#8217;ve received quite a few requests for &#8220;just the install&#8221; from people who read the article, liked the app I built, but don&#8217;t have any interest in the code&#8230; they just want to run the app!

I never really considered that possibility, and in some cases I didn&#8217;t even write the code with that in mind, but now I&#8217;m wondering if I should at least provide a built install file in with the downloadable code sample for non-programmers&#8230; weird thought. Whatever I do, I can&#8217;t support people who use the sample without compiling it themselves&#8230; the code sample is merely a way to show some interesting concept(s), I try to make the applications interesting but they certainly aren&#8217;t the point.
