Recently we launched [a series of videos about VB.NET onto the Visual Basic Developer Center](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/atthemovies){.broken_link}, releasing them only a few at a time... but now we've finished that process and all 101 of the videos are available on the site.

**Just a little note:** If you experience problems watching these videos, you may wish to try installing the [WMP9 codecs](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/9series/codecs/vcm.aspx) (or [WMP9 itself](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/9series/player.aspx), although that is not a requirement) or following the steps in [this KB article](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;306699&Product=wmp).

**Oh, and for those of you who have asked: Yes, we will make them downloadable at some point, but they aren't ready in that format yet. The second most common question has been for a CD/DVD of these files... not sure on that one, I think we will, but I don't have any ETA...**
