[Gus Perez](http://blogs.msdn.com/gusperez/){.broken_link} has posted the binary and source for a little utlity he has dubbed &#8220;ezClip&#8221;;

> _Back in the 7.0 days I wrote a little tool called ezClip. It&#8217;s sole purpose was to allow me to copy/paste files from one command prompt window to another. Our test tree can get pretty deep directory-wise and having to provide full paths to &#8216;copy&#8217; was a pain and instead I often ended up starting up two explorers, one from each window, and then copying via the GUI. This tool made this process much more painless._
