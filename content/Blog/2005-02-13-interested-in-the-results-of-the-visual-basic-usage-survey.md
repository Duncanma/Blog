A few months ago, I [posted a VB survey](http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2004/10/30/856.aspx" target="_blank) up onto my site. That survey received over 1000 responses and I believe it provided some useful data back to the Visual Basic team. I'm considering put the results back up onto my site so you can see them, but I need to determine how much interest there is in seeing this information. Let me know via the comments if you think this would be useful and I'll get started on creating an HTML view of the info.
