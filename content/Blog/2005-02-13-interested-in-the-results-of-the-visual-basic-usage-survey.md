A few months ago, I <a href="http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2004/10/30/856.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">posted a VB survey</a> up onto my site. That survey received over 1000 responses and I believe it provided some useful data back to the Visual Basic team. I&#8217;m considering put the results back up onto my site so you can see them, but I need to determine how much interest there is in seeing this information. Let me know via the comments if you think this would be useful and I&#8217;ll get started on creating an HTML view of the info.
