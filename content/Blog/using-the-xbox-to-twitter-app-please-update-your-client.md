Ok, ok.... so I should have built-in an auto-update, ClickOnce would have been easy enough.... but anyway.... I've added many features to the [Xbox to Twitter application](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/blog/connect-your-xbox-360-gamertag-to-twitter/" target="_blank), including support for only updating when the title being played changes, not showing popups and even a preview of what your twitter updates will look like once they are combined with your template.

To update, uninstall the client using your Control Panel then click on the [install link](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/XboxToTwitter/Install/XboxTwitterInstaller.msi){.broken_link} and reinstall. You should see the new and improved options dialog where you can choose to update only on title changes and also turn off the lower-right notifications if you wish.
