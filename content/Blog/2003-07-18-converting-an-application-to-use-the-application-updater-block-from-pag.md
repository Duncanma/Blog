I recently took an internal MSDN application that I had been running as an HREF-EXE for some months now and converted it to use the [Application Updater Block](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/using/deploying/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnbda/html/updater.asp){.broken_link} from PAG&#8230; it ended up taking many steps, but only a couple of hours (total) to get from start to test.. so I thought I would post my experience with integrating this new block into my application. I have placed it up as a story at <http://weblogs.asp.net/duncanma/story/10221.aspx>{.broken_link}&#8230;
