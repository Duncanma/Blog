      In an earlier post, I mentioned I was going to TechEd... and I said I would post my schedule when I figured it out... well, I haven't figured anything out yet, but I wanted to let folks know the most important thing: <b>I will be bringing my Halo PC CD and a hub...</b> so if anyone wants to play, bring your CD and we'll try to figure out a mini-lan party in a hotel room or something similar ðŸ™‚
