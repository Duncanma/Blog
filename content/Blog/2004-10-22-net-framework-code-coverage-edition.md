A month or so ago, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/adam_nathan" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Adam Nathan</a> annouced the release of the Code Coverage edition of the .NET Framework 2.0 (Beta 1)&#8230; but I was chatting with him recently and he explained the rationale behind this release and really sold me on how you, the developer who will eventually be shipping production code on the 2.0 version of the Framework, really benefit by downloading and using this special version of the Beta&#8230;

Here is a little quote from our email exchange that I think explains the benefits pretty clearly&#8230;

> _“This is something we&rsquo;ve never done before – enabling customers to upload code coverage data (and PInvoke usage data) for their managed applications & components. This data can help us further analyze proposed breaking changes, prioritize WinFX coverage of Win32 APIs, and prioritize testing based on a (hopefully) much larger set of real-world data than what we&rsquo;ve got in-house as part of our AppCompat suite.”_

Now, if that has you interested&#8230; <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/adam_nathan/archive/2004/09/08/227095.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">go check out his original blog post for more info!!</a>
