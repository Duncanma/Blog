As you may have noticed, <a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/blog/tags/Soapbox/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">I&#8217;ve been playing with Soapbox lately</a> and it is rocking. Yep, there are other sites out there, but I&#8217;ve been finding the quality (it is all flash video folks, but there is still a range of quality) of the videos I&#8217;ve uploaded to Soapbox to be a few steps above the other sites (or is it just site now that <a href="http://finance.google.com/finance?cid=2974344" target="_blank">Google bought YouTube</a>?). Laura Foy from on 10 went and <a href="http://www.on10.net/Blogs/laura/soapbox/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">interviewed the Soapbox team</a> and managed to get a special link so that on10.net viewers can sign up for&nbsp;their very own beta account on Soapbox! Watch <a href="http://www.on10.net/Blogs/laura/soapbox/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">the video</a> and then click on the link to get your own account!
