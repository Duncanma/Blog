If you&#8217;ve been reading my blog for awhile, you probably know about <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/using/columns/code4fun/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">my column &#8220;Coding4Fun&#8221;</a>, well now there is an entire site on MSDN going by that name&#8230; to be clear, this is not a site all about my column ðŸ™‚ &#8230; it is a site dedicated to the same concept though, hobbyist coding.

Check it out at: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun" target="_blank" class="broken_link">http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun</a>

**Update:** way more details on the site available [at Dan&#8217;s blog&#8230;](http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2005/04/17/409116.aspx){.broken_link}
