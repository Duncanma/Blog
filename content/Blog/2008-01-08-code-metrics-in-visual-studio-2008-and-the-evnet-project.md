I don&#8217;t know if this is good or bad, but I thought it was neat that I could right-click the main project (excluding all our client script and HTML) that runs behind [on10.net](http://on10.net){.broken_link}, pick code metrics and see cool #s like &#8220;23,442 lines of code&#8221; ðŸ™‚

&nbsp;

Lately though, I&#8217;ve seen us reducing that number while adding features, so this might the highest result I&#8217;ll ever see for this project ðŸ™‚
