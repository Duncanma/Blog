I installed [MCE](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/default.mspx){.broken_link} onto my main home computer recently, which happens to have a modem that supports caller id.... and I was just sitting in front of it tonight watching a recorded episode of “[The Dead Zone](http://www.usanetwork.com/series/thedeadzone/)” when someone called... a nice transparent message floated up telling me their name and #.... and when someone else answered the phone, it just faded away...

Sweet
