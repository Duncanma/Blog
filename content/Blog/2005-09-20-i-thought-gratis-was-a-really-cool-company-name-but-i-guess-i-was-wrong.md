I noticed today that Gratis, the folks behind many of the more well-know &#8220;free stuff&#8221; sites have changed their name to &#8220;FreePay&#8221;&#8230; which seems like a much suckier name than Gratis. Gratis was simple, but yet meaningful. <a href="http://pcs.freepay.com/?r=15127916" target="_blank" class="broken_link">FreePay</a> starts with the right word, but it doesn&#8217;t even make sense to me; I bet there was a legal reason behind the change.

Gratis was the company behind the free flat screen site through which I received <a href="http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2005/04/27/1400.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">my Sony LCD monitor</a>, but the only sites I still follow are those run by OfferCentric, because they offer a wider range of &#8216;gift&#8217; choices, usually including a PayPal option (which seems almost as good as cash to me). I&#8217;ve been sitting at 3-away on <a href="http://www.pvps4free.com/default.aspx?r=160508" target="_blank">PVPs 4 Free</a> for months now, but during that time they have added a bunch of new video players (including the Samsung portable media center, and the new Creative Zen Vision <img src="http://www.pvps4free.com/images/products/139.jpg" align="left" />). I&#8217;m also 3-away on <a href="http://www.mp3players4free.com/default.aspx?r=206786" target="_blank" class="broken_link">MP3 Players 4 Free</a>, and 4-away on <a href="http://www.psps4free.com/default.aspx?r=315551" target="_blank" class="broken_link">PSPs 4 Free</a> (that isn&#8217;t saying much, it only takes 5 to get a PSP ðŸ™‚ ) &#8230; but I&#8217;m not holding my breath, I got a free monitor out of the experience so I figure all the forms, referrals and the hassles have been worth it.
