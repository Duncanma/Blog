&#8220;anon&#8221; (why not leave a name, it is much more fun) posted a comment in response to [my previous entry](http://weblogs.asp.net/duncanma/posts/10050.aspx){.broken_link}, asking why am I including Brad Abrams and Chris Brumme&#8230; as they are not VB-specific&#8230;

Perhaps I need to be clearer about my intent.

&#8220;I&#8217;m interested in blogs that contain useful information for Visual Basic (.NET or not) developers.&#8221; &#8230; the fact that Brad Abrams and Chris Brumme are not tied to any one language is the whole reason why I chose to list them.

In truth, I suspect most .NET postings could be of use to a VB.NET developer, but I can&#8217;t list them all, so I am trying to filter on a few criteria&#8230; the most important of which is &#8220;raw value of the content&#8221;, but great content that is all in C# isn&#8217;t all that useful to someone who works only in VB.NET&#8230; so I&#8217;ll tend to skew towards Visual Basic developers with blogs whenever possible.
