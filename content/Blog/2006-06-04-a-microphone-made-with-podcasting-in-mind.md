I just found <a href="http://www.geekviews.com/?p=11" target="_blank">this article</a> about a series of <a href="http://www.heilsound.com/proline/default.htm" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Heil microphones</a> that work great for podcasting, although I&#8217;m sure they were made with any vocal application in mind&#8230; detailed info in the post, although I thought it was odd that I had to scroll all the way down to find the one single link to the actual microphone(s) being discussed.
