I just found [this article](http://www.geekviews.com/?p=11" target="_blank) about a series of [Heil microphones](http://www.heilsound.com/proline/default.htm" target="_blank) that work great for podcasting, although I'm sure they were made with any vocal application in mind... detailed info in the post, although I thought it was odd that I had to scroll all the way down to find the one single link to the actual microphone(s) being discussed.
