[Robert Green](http://blogs.msdn.com/rgreen_msft" target="_blank) and I are planning a series of articles focused around Visual Basic 2005 Express Edition... quick articles, not a lot of text, but with enough code to do something cool and useful... but we need ideas, and we are looking for submissions of content. If you have some ideas, comment away... and if you'd be interested in submitting something, just let me know!

Thanks!
