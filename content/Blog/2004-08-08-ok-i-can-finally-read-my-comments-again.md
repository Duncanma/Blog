I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be one of many commenting on this, but [the recent updates to .Text on this site](http://weblogs.asp.net/sitenews/archive/2004/08/07/210728.aspx){.broken_link} are a wonderful improvement. For the past while I had been unable to really sift out the good comments from the bad, so real (non-spam) comments to the VB or C# FAQ sites, and to this blog&#8230; were all being drowned out by all of the spam. Keeping up with it (to delete the spam) was almost impossible and I gave up some time ago &#8230; 

We&#8217;ll see how it goes, but I&#8217;m hoping these changes make&nbsp;these blogs sites&nbsp;a less attractive target for spam.
