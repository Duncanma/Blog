Which isn&#8217;t a big deal, but it is amazing to me that <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2006/09/18" target="_blank">the same comic</a> can sometimes make me produce&nbsp;some form of giggle/snort/outburst&nbsp;every single time I see it. After viewing this comic once, I was going back and forth between browsers and it ended up coming up a few different times. Maybe four times. I laughed every time.

On a related note, these <a href="http://xkcd.com/c155.html" target="_blank">two</a> <a href="http://xkcd.com/c135.html" target="_blank">comics</a> produce the same effect&#8230; especially when viewed together.
