I was playing with the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/programmersguide/shell_int/shell_int_programming/ac_ovw.asp" target="_blank">SHAutoComplete API call and the IAutoComplete (2)</a> interface last night (adding auto-complete to an application of mine) and I found a neat article and related component on CodeProject&#8230;

This article is about the AutoComplete features provided by Windows and how to use them with C#. AutoComplete is the ability to expand strings entered into an edit box. The article will develop a class for using this functionality in your applications.
