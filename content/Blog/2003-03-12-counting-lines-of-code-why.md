<font face="Trebuchet MS" color="#008080"><br /> <font face="Trebuchet MS" color="teal">From time to time, when I&#8217;ve shown someone a<br /> system I built, I&#8217;ve been asked &#8220;How many lines of code is that?&#8221;&#8230; and my<br /> answer has always been the same&#8230; &#8220;I have no idea&#8221;.</font><br /> </font> 

I&#8217;ve never even tried to count the lines of code in a project, and I have no
  
idea why I would. Jason mentions in his [post](http://dotnetweblogs.com/Jtucker/posts/3685.aspx){.broken_link} that some
  
people have to account for their lines of code produced in a day and I think
  
that is absolutely crazy. So if you write more lines of code, you are a more
  
productive employee? I hate to point out such an obvious point, but I&#8217;d like to
  
think that the important point is how many bugs you fixed or how many features
  
you completed&#8230;. regardless of how much typing it required.

Oh well, at least I don&#8217;t have to count my lines of code&#8230; and I don&#8217;t
  
intend to ever start. It is worth pointing out, since I am mostly a writer these
  
days, I don&#8217;t count the words in my articles (or pages) either. The exception
  
would be if I was being paid by the word, but as a general rule I don&#8217;t like to
  
pay or be paid by the word/page&#8230; pay me to cover a topic to a certain depth
  
and that should be enough. If I hand in 2 pages and you expected 20, read the
  
pages&#8230; did I cover the material, if not then don&#8217;t pay me&#8230; ok, now I am
  
rambling so I had better hit post&#8230;
