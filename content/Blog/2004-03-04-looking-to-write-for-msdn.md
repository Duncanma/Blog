Someone recently asked me for our template, style guidelines and other details about writing for MSDN. I wanted to find the public page about this, so I dug around for what seemed like ages and **couldn&#8217;t find anything** even though I knew this was up on MSDN somewhere.

Eventually, I resorted to search and tracked it down at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/aboutmsdn/submit.asp" target="_blank" class="broken_link">http://msdn.microsoft.com/aboutmsdn/submit.asp</a>. Since it was so hard for me to find, I thought I should bubble it up to the front page of VB and C#, in case anyone else is looking for it ðŸ™‚ 

**Update:** Stephen Toub from MSDN Magazine just sent me the corresponding link for submissions to their publication&#8230; [http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/submit.aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/submit.aspxAnother){.broken_link}

**Another Update:** For some reason, this posts gets a lot of comments from people looking for a free download of MSDN. That is not what this post is about, it is about **writing articles** for MSDN. Go ahead and ask for a free copy of MSDN, I&#8217;m just going to ignore it&#8230;. that isn&#8217;t something I can provide.
