First things first&#8230;. this should have been two blog entries&#8230; because it is way too long for one, and because the two topics are not related&#8230; so here I end up, interested only in the hosting of code editors, and I have to link to that other stuff as well&#8230; but I digress&#8230; ðŸ™‚

The gist of the post (at the least second half that I&#8217;m interested in) is that I can host a copy of the code editing window from VS inside a tool window when I&#8217;m making my own add-in or other customization within VS&#8230; but my question is, and I haven&#8217;t had time to check this out, would this allow me to host the same code editing window within an external Windows Forms application that isn&#8217;t in any way hosted in or linked to VS?

I wonder&#8230;
