A neat little discussion about Random Number generators (or pseudo-random that is) has been happening on [GDN](https://www.gotdotnet.com) for the last day or so, [http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/MessageBoard/Thread.aspx?id=169292&Page=1#169538](https://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/MessageBoard/Thread.aspx?id=169292&Page=1#169538)

neat stuff....
