As I discussed in <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/duncanma/archive/2004/08/05/209654.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">an earlier post</a>, I wanted to know if people found preview articles useful&#8230; and at least a few people said they did, so here is another one&#8230;.

> **<a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/writing/Previews/ContentRotator/default.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Rotating Is Fun<br /> </a>**
  
> **Summary:** Duncan Mackenzie describes the creation of a simple &lsquo;content rotator&rsquo; in ASP.NET 

Feedback, via the blog or the feedback link at the bottom of <a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/writing/Previews/ContentRotator/default.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">the article page</a>, is always welcome!
