I need authentication and role based security for another project that is _coming soon_, so I&#8217;ve put forums up at <a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/forums/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/forums/</a> &#8230; nothing there at the moment, but feel free to visit the &#8216;discussion&#8217; forum and contribute your ideas&#8230;

  * What forums should I add? I was thinking one per article I write (for ongoing discussion) but what else?
  * There are lots of forums in the world, is there something missing that could exist&#8230;
