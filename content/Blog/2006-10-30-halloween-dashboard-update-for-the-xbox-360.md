Have you seen [this list of features](http://www.unscripted360.com/2006/10/30/xbox-360-fall-system-update/)?

Absolutely crazy list&#8230; my favorites (lots of them are great, but these are ones that either I had already been wishing for or that I know will be a big deal to me):

  * Stream WMV video from a Windows PC running Windows Media Player 11, Zune software, or Windows Media Connect.
  * Play video from storage devices such as USB flash drives, Xbox 360 Memory Units, etc. 
  * Play video from CD or DVD data discs. 
      * Xbox 360 Wireless Headset support, including battery level indicator in the Xbox Guide.
      * Set up automatic downloads of newly released Xbox Live Arcade trial games.
      * Optionally disable notifications from Xbox Live while watching DVD movies (I&#8217;ve turned notifications off across the board because of this)</ul> 
    You really need to see the <a href="http://www.unscripted360.com/2006/10/30/xbox-360-fall-system-update/" target="_blank">full list of updates</a> though, this is a big release (1080p support folks&#8230; free&#8230; tomorrow&#8230; not in my favorites list because I don&#8217;t have a TV that supports it&#8230; but if you do, rock on).
