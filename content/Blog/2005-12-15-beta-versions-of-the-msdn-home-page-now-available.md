I&#8217;ve been working (as part of a large team!) on the new platform for MSDN, which is up and running at <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com" target="_blank">http://msdn2.microsoft.com</a>&#8230; and now you can see prototype versions of the MSDN home page ontop of that same platform. Check it out here [<a href="http://beta.msdn.microsoft.com/default.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">http://beta.msdn.microsoft.com/default.aspx</a>]. The new home page demonstrates some of the personalization/profile features that will end up on the final MSDN site in the near future.
