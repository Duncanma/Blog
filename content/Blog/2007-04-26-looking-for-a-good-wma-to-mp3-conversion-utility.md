  * for use on non-DRM&#8217;d files (one that can do both is fine&#8230; it just isn&#8217;t what I&#8217;m going to use it for)
  * must transfer meta data correctly (ID3 tags)
  * batch would be great, point it at a folder structure and let it run

I&#8217;ve tried a couple, but so far I haven&#8217;t found a single free one that works well&#8230; I&#8217;d be willing to buy something but I think I really would like a recommendation in that case&#8230; there are too many out there and I&#8217;m not having any luck finding the &#8216;best&#8217; one.

Let me know if anyone has any ideas! Thanks!!
