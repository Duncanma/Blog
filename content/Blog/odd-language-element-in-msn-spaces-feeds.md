<img src="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/images/JapaneseLanguageFeeds.png" align="right" />Perhaps a little bug left over from when they first launched in Japan, but the MSN Spaces feeds seem to specify a language code for at least one english language feed ([Brian's](http://www.bufferoverrun.net" target="_blank))... but it does return en-US for some others. Hmm... it also seems to specify en-US for [some feeds](http://spaces.msn.com/godpapa123/" target="_blank) that are quite obviously not... perhaps choosing your language is a per-blog setting that people aren't aware of? I'm not sure if it matters all that much, other than to blog indexers, if the character set and encoding is correct, the lanugage element isn't really important to aggregators or browsers, but since it changes from feed to feed it must be based on some sort of per-blog or per-user setting.
