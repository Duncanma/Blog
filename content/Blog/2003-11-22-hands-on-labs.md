All of the labs install to your My Documents folder, but most of the lab instructions assume a certain directory (c:\labs for the SQL ones)&#8230; so&#8230; you will either be copying files around a bit, adjusting the instructions or having to run some setup code before you can use the labs. In the case of SQL, there is a HOL SETUP folder, but I don&#8217;t have any guidance for you in terms of how these labs are supposed to be configured. Of course, Yukon needs to be installed, that would be a good starting point for the SQL labs. 

I&#8217;d suggest you post your questions about the labs to the appropriate newsgroup under <a href="http://communities.microsoft.com/newsgroups/default.asp?icp=whidbey&slcid=us" target="_blank" class="broken_link">http://communities.microsoft.com/newsgroups/default.asp?icp=whidbey&slcid=us</a> (you&#8217;ll find a SQL CLR one there that might be useful for Yukon questions) and I&#8217;ll post any useful information that I find out as well.
