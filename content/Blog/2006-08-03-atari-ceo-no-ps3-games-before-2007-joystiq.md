I was surprised early to hear that God of War II was a PS2 game&#8230; and now [this](http://www.joystiq.com/2006/08/02/atari-ceo-no-atari-ps3-games-before-2007/)? I think it just the price that is scaring developers&#8230; scary to develop for a console that **seems** out of the price range of your target audience. I say &#8220;seems&#8221; because despite my own (biased) negative thoughts about the PS3, I expect it to be a pretty impressive machine&#8230; one that quite a few people will pick up. I do agree with other people&#8217;s predictions that it will lag behind the 360, the $$ will see to that, but I don&#8217;t think anyone expects it to flop&#8230; 

I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll end up getting a PS2 though, as tempting as it is at the low-low refurbished prices you can find it at now; the idea was to pick up a used one and an EyeToy and then try to lose some weight playing Kinetic&#8230; but all that work for one game seems like a bad idea. Instead I need to find some way to do some mild exercise while playing **any** game on my 360. It wouldn&#8217;t be instead of my normal exercise routine, but every little bit counts. A recumbent exercise bike seems like a possible solution, although I don&#8217;t think my wife wants one in our living room.
