The latest &#8216;issue' of my Coding 4 Fun column has been published to MSDN;

> [Duncan Mackenzie describes how to control a serial-portâ€“connected LCD panel using Microsoft Visual Basic .NET and Microsoft Visual C# .NET.](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/using/columns/code4fun/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun12102003.asp)

It is probably worth mentioning that I have hidden a CRC16 class in the code download as well, so even if you aren't into hooking up an LCD panel, that CRC stuff might be of use!
