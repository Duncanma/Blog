My [music system](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/musicxp){.broken_link} is finally hooked back up in my new house (after months of sitting unplugged) but I didn&#8217;t have a network connection available for it. Well, the recent release of some new networking standards have made 802.11b adapters rather cheap so I picked one up today and went to install it onto my music system&#8230;. hmm&#8230; no LAN, no CD, no floppy&#8230; no way to get drivers to this machine at all&#8230; so no way to install the new device. Well, once the device is installed, I&#8217;ll be set because I&#8217;ll have a network connection, but that doesn&#8217;t really help me too much&#8230; (There&#8217;s a hole in the bucket&#8230;)

What to do? I&#8217;m too lazy to unplug the system and snake the power cable out from behind the entertainment center so that I can move it to within ethernet cable distance, so I took my digital camera, with its 128mb memory stick and hooked it up to my PC. Turns out the entire install disk for the adapter is 118mb so I copied the whole thing onto the camera&#8217;s memory and then took the camera to the music system&#8230;. worked fine, but I would have hated to have to explain it to my wife if she came downstairs (well, honey&#8230; you see, I&#8217;m using our camera as a portable floppy disk&#8230; no really, there is a good reason&#8230;)
