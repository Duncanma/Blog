Ok, so if I was dealing with a 360, I could just pick up the VGA output cable&#8230; but for some reason, we never made one of those for the original Xbox. Now, I&#8217;ve found&nbsp;<a href="http://www.x2vga.com/" target="_blank">some companies that make reasonably priced converters from component video inputs to VGA</a> (I&#8217;ve found several in the unreasonable price range too) but either they are permantely out of stock&#8230; or [they](http://www.ddrgame.com/xbox1.html) look a little &#8230; hmm&#8230; how to say this, not like someone I&#8217;d like to give my credit card to?

Anyone else doing this? What are you using?
