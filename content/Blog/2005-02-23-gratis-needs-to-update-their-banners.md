<a href="http://www.gratisnetwork.com/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Gratis</a>, the company behind the various www.free\***.com sites (and the original <a href="http://www.freeiPods.com/?r=14756414" target="_blank">free iPod</a> folks), provide banners for use on sites like mine, but they don&#8217;t really keep them up to date. For example, the banner for the <a href="http://www.FreeDesktopPC.com/?r=15127916" target="_blank">Free PC site</a> is all about the Dell machine you can get, but they recently added a Sony Vaio as a possible choice. Now, I&#8217;m not sure why, since its specs are not that different from the Dell, but the Sony machine just seems more appealing ðŸ™‚ &#8230; here is Gratis&#8217;s blurb on the new box:

_Got a digital lifestyle? Well, <a href="http://www.FreeDesktopPC.com/?r=15127916" target="_blank">www.FreeDesktopPC.com</a> is about to make your life a whole lot easier! We&#8217;re now offering Sony&#8217;s brand new Vaio computer, loaded with multimedia software to help digitize all parts of your life.

What about you, what PC manufacturer do you prefer? I have two Dells at home, another Dell at work, and a Compaq/HP laptop&#8230; I&#8217;m pretty happy with the Dell boxes (which is why I bought my last home machine in 99, and then another Dell this year) although I&#8217;ve heard that their power supplies use a different pin configuration than &#8216;standard&#8217;, which has prevented me from replacing my power supply with a quiet one &#8230; actually I have no idea if that rumour is true, but it has meant that I need to do some research before I can buy a new PSU so it is has caused me to delay that purchase for about a year!

FWIW, <a href="http://www.FreeFlatScreens.com/?r=13882371" target="_blank">the free flat screen site</a> added a new monitor too, a 19&#8243; Sony&#8230; not a huge jump in specs over the 17&#8243; that they had, but still&#8230; 19&#8243; > 17&#8243; ðŸ™‚
