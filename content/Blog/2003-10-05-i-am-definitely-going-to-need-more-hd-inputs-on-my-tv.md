I have been drooling over [this](http://www.rokulabs.com/) for that last few weeks&#8230; 

> _**inner monologue:** it doesn&#8217;t do anything that I really need, and if I ever get around to hooking my [current music system](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/musicxp){.broken_link} up with something better than S-Video, I could probably replicate its functionality in a pretty short period of time&#8230;._

but, it sure looks cool, and that has added it to an overly long list of &#8216;things I would buy if I had the $$ to order them and the time to use them&#8217;. 

It seems like a slightly more efficient idea to pay the $120 for [a VGA-Component adapter](http://www.smarthome.com/77706.html) for my music system (so that it displays at 720 progressive, instead of 480 interlaced) and then build photo-viewing/slideshow support into it, but gadget-love isn&#8217;t about efficiency.

We (the content strategist team at MSDN) are heading down to Fry&#8217;s en masse on Tuesday, which should be a wonderful display of technology lust and perhaps even acquisition (although not by me, I&#8217;ve sated my gadget lust for a few months with that [DVI-equipped DVD player](http://www.samsungusa.com/cgi-bin/nabc/product/b2c_product_detail.jsp?eUser=&prod_id=DVD-HD931%2fXAA){.broken_link})&#8230; yup, should be a fun time for all.
