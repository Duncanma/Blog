<font face="Trebuchet MS" color="teal">Whenever I shut<br /> down my laptop, it is a very painful experience&#8230; one by one I watch&nbsp;a<br /> series of programs die a painful death, as they refuse to shut down gracefully.<br /> The error messages about &#8220;Windows Stations&#8221; that are closing are very useful,<br /> but somehow the entire process (which sometimes involves clicking a few &#8220;End<br /> Task&#8221; buttons, and maybe even selecting Shut Down all over again because half of<br /> my system is still breathing) reminds me a lot of watching someone you love<br /> learning to drive with your stick-shift sportscar. You try to smile and focus on<br /> the end result, but each event, each horrible noise or lurching movement, forces<br /> a wince out of you.</font> 

<font face="Trebuchet MS" color="teal">I really like both of the &#8220;people&#8221;<br /> involved (my laptop and Windows XP), but watching the horrible process that<br /> occurs when I turn my machine off is almost enough to make me stick with standby<br /> only from this point on.</font>
