Wow, back in Winnipeg this amount of snow wouldn't likely cause much of a slow down... but here... I'm at home and [so are lots of my team mates](http://www.jeffsandquist.com/SnowDay.aspx){.broken_link}. Pretty snow though ðŸ™‚

I have remote access and a laptop with VS 2005 though... fully productive and a coffee pot that is even closer than at work!
