For the last few weeks I&#8217;ve had a graphic and link to a <a href="http://xbox360s.freepay.com/?r=23139488" target="_blank" class="broken_link">&#8216;free Xbox 360&#8217; site</a> up as a banner on my blog pages, and it has received a lot of clicks (and 12 or so sign-ups, although no one has completed an offer yet&#8230;). I&#8217;m guessing that with the difficulty of obtaining a pre-order at this close to the release, the idea of a free Xbox 360 is pretty appealing. Personally, I headed down to the local EB Games and put down a $50 deposit on an Xbox 360 in one of their future allotments (all the machines in the first allotment were already pre-sold). I figured that if I didn&#8217;t do that, I&#8217;d be driving around to Walmart and Toys R&#8217; Us for days before I managed to find a machine for sale at the end of November.
