One of the big reasons [I redesigned the poll component](http://weblogs.asp.net/duncanma/archive/2004/06/15/156543.aspx){.broken_link}, was so that I could track votes over time&#8230; I did this by adding a &#8216;dateVoted&#8217; column to my vote table, and then using an “On Insert” trigger to set that column to the current date/time&#8230;. peachy keen, except when I exported the tables and stored procs to my live SQL box, I forgot to include my triggers&#8230; so all the votes on my previous poll have no date/time info. Yeesh. Oh well, not a big deal since I&#8217;m still in the testing/building stage, but still a very silly mistake.

I&#8217;ve put up [a new poll](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net) though&#8230; I have a lot of article ideas for my [Coding 4 Fun columns](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/using/columns/code4fun/default.aspx){.broken_link} and I thought I&#8217;d ask people what topic they would like to see sooner rather than later&#8230;
