<img align="right" src="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/images/dsc01756.jpg" />The theme at my son's preschool last week was Caterpillars, and it also happened to be his turn to bring the snack (the kids rotate through this task, bring snacks/juice for 16 people)... so my wife went all-out and baked these breadstick-larva creations...

<img align="left" src="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/images/dsc01763.jpg" />... and these butterfly cookies. Recipe for the breadstick/caterpillars is [here](http://familycrafts.about.com/od/creativesnacks/r/caterpilrecipe.htm)

Very yummy and supposedly quite well received by the kids...
