title: Adhoc and Random
type: posts

I see by [Kent's latest post](https://weblogs.asp.net/ksharkey/posts/31496.aspx) that we've gone public with our new aliases.. in the great tradition of [Early and Adopter](https://radio.weblogs.com/0117167/), we have decided we should be known as 'adhoc and random'. Details won't be coming, but let's just say that we have a reputation at [our workplace](https://msdn.microsoft.com) as being a bit too quick to write and ship code when we want something done...

We are working on that problem though... I think we are scheduled to attend a support group next week, and we aren't allowed to code during the meeting....

Oh, and the PDC <font color="#0000ff">is almost sold out... wow... and in a year where conferences having been doing badly in general, that is quite impressive.
