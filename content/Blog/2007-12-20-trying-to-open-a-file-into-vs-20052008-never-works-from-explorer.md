So I have a file on disk, web.config in this case, and I right click and pick &#8216;open with | Visual Studio 2008&#8217; &#8230; and I get this:

&nbsp;

Windows cannot find &#8216;C:\projects\9\web.config&#8217;. Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again. 

[OK] 

&nbsp; 

VS 2008 opens, but no file. If I then pick the file from File | Open it works fine&#8230; what the hell? As far as I can remember, this was true with VS 2005 and it has annoyed me every day&#8230;
