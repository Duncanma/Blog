Yesterday [I posted about the use of the feed icon](http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2006/01/16/3548.aspx" target="_blank) on [Media Center Sandbox](http://blog.mediacentersandbox.com/" title="Media Center Sandbox" target="_blank) and suggested a few changes. Last night, I get an email from [Charlie Owen](http://blog.retrosight.com/" target="_blank), one of the principals of the sandbox site, and the site is completely updated. Now, I don't know if I caused any change or if the change was just in the works anyway.... but regardless, I like the new look and the [icons](http://www.feedicons.com" title="Site about the feed icon" target="_blank) look great!
