In a recent post on Microsoft 10, <a href="http://on10.net/Blogs/Education/6747/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Alfred talks about the idea and controversy around having students equipped with laptops</a>. Check out his post for the full details, but to summarize&#8230; it can work well, but it has to be done right, with the right software and teachers&#8230; I agree with Alfred on this, but I also think it isn&#8217;t that big of a surprise. This same concept applies in just about everything whether it is software engineering, fitness or even lawn care. The same technology or plan can succeed or fail because of some aspect of the implementation. The right tools are important, but it is more important that people plan carefully and are ready to make the most of whatever technology they are using or deploying.

So the real question is, what knowledge needs to be shared&nbsp;so that schools can make the most out of their computer resources?
