I stumbled upon the <a href="http://psp.connect.com/" target="_blank">PSP Connect</a> site a few weeks ago, and I&#8217;ve been really enjoying it as a source of video for my Zune. This site, since it is aimed at the PSP, has a ton of great 320&#215;240 MP4 content, including a lot of popular viral videos, <a href="http://psp.connect.com/product/uni-evan-almighty-trailer-for-psp.php" target="_blank">movie trailers</a> (of all the upcoming Sony movies for sure) and even ongoing series such as the &#8216;Spartan&#8217; and &#8216;<a href="http://psp.connect.com/product/mna-borg-war-episode-1.php" target="_blank">Borg</a>&#8216; series of machinima. Lots of this content is available elsewhere, but on this site you can download good quality versions without having to hack out some flash video (like YouTube or Soapbox) and your Zune software can understand the MP4 file format as is. Of course, the Zune software will need to convert it to a WMV on the way into your device, but it runs through these little videos fairly quickly and with great results.
