In September of last year I signed up for <a href="http://www.proclub.com/Home/MedicalWellness/2020Lifestyles/tabid/488/Default.aspx" target="_blank">the 20/20 program at the Pro Club</a>, a 25 week weight-loss program that includes personal training, dietitian appointments and even group therapy (yay!). Well, I&#8217;m pretty much wrapped up on the program, and a few weeks ago they had me in to take measurements and a photo&#8230; they took a photo at the beginning as well, so we end up with the classic before and after comparision.

Overall I lost 30 pounds, but that is only one number&#8230; I dropped six inches around my waist (so none of my pants fit), my bad cholesterol went down, my good cholesterol went up&#8230; blood pressure dropped&#8230; nothing but good stuff.

I&#8217;ll be posting some other details over time, about the program and about what I&#8217;m doing now for exercise and diet, but if you&#8217;re interested in specific details about anything, just post a comment to let me know.
