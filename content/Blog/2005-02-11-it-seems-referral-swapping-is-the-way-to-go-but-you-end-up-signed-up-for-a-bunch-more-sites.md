I signed up for <a href="http://www.refstop.com/register.htm?r=Duncanma" target="_blank">RefStop</a>, where you create a list of the current &#8216;free offer&#8217; sites that you have accounts with and then you are matched up with folks who can do a referral for you in return for you doing one for them&#8230; and it works pretty good, I now have 5 out of the 8 I need for <a href="http://www.FreeFlatScreens.com/?r=13882371" target="_blank">the Free Flat Screen offer</a>, and 7 out of the 10 I need for <a href="http://www.macminis4free.com/default.aspx?r=171215" target="_blank" class="broken_link">the Mac Mini site</a> (from which I actually have selected the $450 paypal offer, not the mini mac itself &#8230; this is a nice feature of any of the sites run by OfferCentric, they all have a Pay Pal option instead of the standard items). In the process though, I ended up signing up for a ton of trial offers (full list of the sites I have accounts with is <a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/Forums/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=61" target="_blank" class="broken_link">here</a>). Columbia House, BMG music, even AOL ðŸ™‚

Some of the trial offers have been completely worth it though, I signed up for <a href="http://www.Audible.com" target="_blank">Audible.com</a> and burned the 3-CDs worth of audio for &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0142000280/duncanmackenz-20?creative=327641&#038;camp=14573&#038;link_code=as1" target="_blank">Getting Things Done</a>&#8221; and listening to that type of book is certainly is a nice way to spend the drive into work&#8230;
