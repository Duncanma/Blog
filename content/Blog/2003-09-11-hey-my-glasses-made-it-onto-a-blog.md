Kent has been posting pics and my glasses made it into [the shot](http://weblogs.asp.net/ksharkey/posts/26944.aspx){.broken_link}! Wow, this is pretty exciting, I think I&#8217;ll go lie down.

Here&#8217;s another pic from that day&#8230; just to keep up with the trend;

_note the lack of glasses&#8230; generally a sign of a bad day,
