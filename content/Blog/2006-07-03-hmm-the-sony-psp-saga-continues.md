Update on <a href="http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2006/07/01/5634.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">the bricked PSP</a>&#8230; So I spoke to a someone at the local Sony retail store&#8230; $120 (CDN) to fix the PSP. Keeping in mind that all that my nephew did was turn it off when he saw a dialog he didn&#8217;t understand, that is a lot of money. I&#8217;m especially unhappy because I know that this must be a common issue and a simple fix (open it up, flash the chips to the factory default firmware and then maybe re-update to the latest firmware&#8230; all simple procedures, but ones that only Sony can do once the machine refuses to start up).
