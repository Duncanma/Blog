I'm getting a little tired of playing with people I don't know... so if anyone is into playing Halo feel free to try to track me down or if someone felt like it, we could even set up our own game(s)... my Halo name is, boringly enough, "Duncanma" so you can try to find me online using Game Spy (installed with Halo)...
