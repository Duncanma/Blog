[This recent MSDN magazine article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/03/06/ZipCompression/){.broken_link} is pretty cool. Although the title suggests it is all about Zip Compression, the real power of this article is that it points out that the J# libraries are available from **any .NET language**, providing your C#/VB.NET apps with a lot more than just zip support (although that is pretty neat too).
