In <a href="http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2004/09/01/621.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">a previous post</a>, I mentioned that a flaw in the installation routines for <a href="http://www.telligentsystems.com/Solutions/Forums" target="_blank" class="broken_link">telligent&#8217;s forum system</a> resulted in the deletion of a fairly important set of data&#8230; well, after posting that, a few things happened that impressed me&#8230;

  * My web host, <a href="http://www.easerve.com/hosting/eris1109/aspnet.aspx" target="_blank">easerve</a>, contacted me and let me know they had daily backups of my data available&#8230; and once I told them the date/time at which I blew away my data, they&#8217;d provide the appropriate backup file&#8230; (which they did, and I&#8217;m rocking along now with my old data back&#8230;) &#8230; yet another great bit of customer service from easerve&#8230; 
      * <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rhoward" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Rob Howard</a> and <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jalexander/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Jason Alexander</a>, both from <a href="http://www.telligentsystems.com/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">telligent</a> responded with both &#8216;sorry&#8217; and &#8216;we&#8217;ll fix our scripts&#8217;&#8230; a very quick response considering I didn&#8217;t even email them about it&#8230; 

Overall, my annoying little incident resulted in a great response from two different groups&#8230; very nice.
