Some people have great ideas, like Tom Werner&#8217;s Gravatar (Globally Recognized Avatar) site&#8230; <a href="http://www.gravatar.com/about.php" target="_blank">a single place on the web to upload an avatar</a> that any blog software can then retrieve using a fairly easily constructed URL. Neat stuff, I think I&#8217;ll add it to my site.
