Marshillboy from Zuneboards.com has <a href="http://www.zuneboards.com/content/view/52/2/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">posted a utility that lets you connect your Zune up to multiple PCs as if they were all the &#8216;home&#8217; PC</a>. Personally I like the idea, although the main benefit for me would be if it didn&#8217;t show any UI&#8230; right now, the &#8216;hack&#8217; pops up its own dialog in place of the Zune one&#8230; so I have to click &#8216;Next&#8217; either way. Why would I want that?
