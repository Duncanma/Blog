As per the blog entry "[Feed icons](http://blogs.msdn.com/justsean/archive/2005/12/30/508181.aspx "Microsoft WebBlogs")" and using icons pulled from the new [feedicons](http://www.feedicons.com) site. Hopefully [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com) will follow suit as well, which would probably be pretty easy... it looks like they are mostly linking every instance of the &#8216;old' RSS icon to the same graphic. I'll suggest it and we'll see what happens.
