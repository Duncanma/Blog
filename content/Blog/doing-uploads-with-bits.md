title: Doing uploads with BITS
type: posts
---
I wrote a couple of articles on BITS in the past (creating a [wrapper](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwxp/html/WinXP_BITS.asp), then [background copying](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun02282003.asp), then [digital grandma](https://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/default.aspx?pull=/msdnmag/issues/04/11/AdvancedBasics/default.aspx)) but it was all about downloading files. Starting with BITS 1.5, you can also upload files... is that topic of interest to folks? Just FYI, you need web server support to make this work, as detailed [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/bits/bits/iis_requirements_for_bits_uploads.asp).
