set s=c10 (or s=on10) for searching <http://on10.net>{.broken_link} instead, or remove it altogether to search both sites (using s or q twice won't work)

q=<search term> .... multi word terms need to within quotes, like this;

 

[http://www.mscommunities.com/MixItUp/Search/Default.aspx?s=c9&q="Visual%20Studio"](http://www.mscommunities.com/MixItUp/Search/Default.aspx?s=c9&q="Visual%20Studio" "http://www.mscommunities.com/MixItUp/Search/Default.aspx?s=c9&q="Visual%20Studio""){.broken_link}
