I wrote a couple of articles on BITS in the past (creating a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwxp/html/WinXP_BITS.asp" target="_blank">wrapper</a>, then <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun02282003.asp" target="_blank">background copying</a>, then <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/default.aspx?pull=/msdnmag/issues/04/11/AdvancedBasics/default.aspx" target="_blank">digital grandma</a>) but it was all about downloading files. Starting with BITS 1.5, you can also upload files&#8230; is that topic of interest to folks? Just FYI, you need web server support to make this work, as detailed <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/bits/bits/iis_requirements_for_bits_uploads.asp" target="_blank" class="broken_link">here</a>.
