My Advanced Basics column from the October 2004 issue is now up online&#8230; 

> **<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/04/10/AdvancedBasics/default.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Building a Progress Bar that Doesn&#8217;t Progress</a>** 

and if you think that title is odd, here is what <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Chris Sells</a> had to say when he first heard it&#8230; (comments used 100% without permission, but I figure he won&#8217;t mind)&#8230; 

> _&#8220;I canâ€™t wait to read &#8216;Building a Progress Bar that Doesn&#8217;t Progress.&#8217; I assume follow on articles will cover &#8216;Building a Button that Doesn&#8217;t Butt&#8217; and &#8216;Building a Status Bar that Doesn&#8217;t Stat?&#8217; : )&#8221;_ 

yep, it is great having him on the team&#8230;
