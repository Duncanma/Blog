> _The Visual Studio debugger supports debugging both .NET code and native code at the same time. We call this &lsquo;interop&rsquo;. At first glance, this might not seem like much of an accomplishment. After all, we support debugging .NET code well enough, and we support debugging native code. What&rsquo;s so hard about doing both at the same time?_
