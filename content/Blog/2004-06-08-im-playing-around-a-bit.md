I&#8217;ve added some functionality to my personal site because I now have SQL Server available on the back end&#8230; so, as a test, I&#8217;ve put a voting component onto the home page at <a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net" target="_blank">http://www.duncanmackenzie.net</a> &#8230; I plan to add some features to it (like &#8216;just show me the results, I don&#8217;t want to vote&#8217;), but for now feel free to check it out as it is. 

Note that, at the moment, I am just using the component that is in use on <a href="http://www.asp.net" target="_blank">www.asp.net</a> and is available from the &#8216;control gallery&#8217; on that site.
