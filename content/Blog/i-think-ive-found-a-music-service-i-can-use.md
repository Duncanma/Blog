title: I think I've found a music service I can use...

I'm going to buy an album as download-only today, from [www.buymusic.com](https://www.buymusic.com), and I hope it all works out as good as it sounds (no pun intended!). My biggest worry when downloading music from the various sites is that I won't be able to fit the DRM requirements into my digital music lifestyle. I listen to music on my laptop, my home computer, on [my music system PC](https://www.duncanmackenzie.net/musicxp), on my Rio WMA player and sometimes on CDs in the car... but most of the music sites out there (that I've visited) didn't seem to allow all of those uses... but buymusic.com says it allows use on 3 PCs (just enough for me to avoid moving my licenses around all the time!), on a portable device and burned onto CD a few times (10 I think). That should cover me perfectly, but I have to try it out to be sure. I think I'll buy the new Sting album tonight for $9 something USD, and see how it goes.
I wonder what happens when I wipe and rebuild my machine? Maybe that isn't common for most of their customers, but it certainly is a regular occurence for me!
