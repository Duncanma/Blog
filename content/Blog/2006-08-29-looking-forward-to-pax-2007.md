PAX was a blast, I went back for day 2 and spent almost all the day at the exhibition hall&#8230; tons of cool demos and people! I was able to stop at the Xbox booth and chat with [Trixie](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/personality/trixie/default.htm){.broken_link} (as [Brian mentions here](http://brianjo.spaces.live.com/blog/)), which was great because she is one of those people that I've emailed quite a bit but never met in person.

I also managed to run into Frank O'Connor from Bungie and interview him about the Halo 2 team that Bungie was entering into the console tournament, which seemed really unfair but he assured me that they weren't that good of players ðŸ™‚

Brian and I also interviewed some folks about Warhammer Online, Wizards of the Coast's new "Goblin Game" &#8230; lots of fun
