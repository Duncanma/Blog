This group, <a href="http://www.bridgesweb.org" target="_blank">http://www.bridgesweb.org</a>, is an amazing example of what I think <a href="http://on10.net/about.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">http://on10.net</a> is all about. Phil Borges and the other folks involved with this non-profit devote an enormous amount of time to travelling the world and helping kids tell their stories using the new technologies available today. Here is a shot I took today of one of the workshop participants (Mel) helping one of the kids (Stefano?) take some great shots of a steam engine&#8230; and yes, I suck at remembering names!
