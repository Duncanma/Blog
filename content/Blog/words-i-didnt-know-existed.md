title: Words I didn't know existed...
type: posts

After going to **the movie** this morning (movies in the morning just aren't natural, by the way) with Kent, I was reading some reviews of Matrix 2 and I came upon [a word](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/callipygian)that had me visiting [www.dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/) moments later.

I didn't realize there were words for this type of thing... though more words along the same theme could make for interesting, if cryptic, conversations.
