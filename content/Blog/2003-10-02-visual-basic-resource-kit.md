The download isn&#8217;t up yet, it takes some time to sign and virus scan an entire CD packaged up as a zip, but the site that details what is included is there!

Check out <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/vbrkit/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/vbrkit</a> for all the details, and you can even order yourself a copy of the CD if you want to avoid the downloading hassles&#8230;

Quick highlights; a ton of free controls (not just trial editions) from Component One, Dundas, Infragistics, and Sax (SaxÂ has provided a serial communication control!!!!), a pile of sample code, whitepapers and multi-media content as well.

Oh, and just a small point&#8230; all of the controls should work fine in C# as far as I know ðŸ™‚
