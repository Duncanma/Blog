That was what my 2-yr old son received last night&#8230; ouch. We were at a birthday party for a friend of ours and there were lots of kids running around&#8230; oops, Connor fell and slammed his forehead right into the corner of a wall. Cut right to the bone and bleeding like crazy. What a trooper though, he cried for a bit, mostly because of the look on all of the adult&#8217;s faces, but he had stopped before I could even get him to the truck for a drive to the hospital. Didn&#8217;t stop bleeding for a long time, but he was happy and even excited to be going to the hospital&#8230;. he likes doctors. The cut was too big for &#8220;glue&#8221;, which is a new thing to me but sounds cool, so he had to get stitches. It was a good two hours in total as we waited in one room after another before a doctor was able to stitch him up, but it was a great experience at the hospital, everyone was great and in the end he went home with a new &#8220;Evergreen Hospital&#8221; teddy bear!

I don&#8217;t know what it felt like to have those stitches put in, but I can tell you that it was very difficult for his parents to watch while we held him down for the procedure&#8230; and I&#8217;m sure he won&#8217;t be quite as friendly towards doctors for some time.
