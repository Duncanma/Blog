I'm up to 6 out of 8 referals on [the free flat screen offer site](http://www.FreeFlatScreens.com/?r=13882371), it will be interesting to see what the &#8216;order' process is like if I ever get to 8. Of course, in the time it has taken, I could have probably found some other way to get a LCD monitor for my wife's computer, but that wouldn't be sporting ðŸ™‚
