[Aaron Brethorst](http://www.brethorsting.com/mt3/" target="_blank) has a little page of his code samples up at [http://www.brethorsting.com/code/](http://www.brethorsting.com/code/" target="_blank) which include a few interesting items including **a software version of the Enigma machine in C#**. Cool stuff. Aaron is also the author of [iRooster, an alarm clock application (that uses playlists from iTunes)](http://www.sixdollarchimp.com/" target="_blank) which also looks neat, but runs on the Mac so it isn't something that I have any real use for... :).
