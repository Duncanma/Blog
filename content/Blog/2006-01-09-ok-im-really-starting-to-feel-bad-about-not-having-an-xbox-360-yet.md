<a href="http://www.xbox4dummies.com" title="Xbox 360 for Dummies" target="_blank" class="broken_link">My book is about to come out</a> (don&#8217;t worry, I had a 360 to use while writing the book&#8230; so my lack of one now does not reduce the accuracy of the book ðŸ™‚ ), and I work at a place with probably one of the world&#8217;s highest concentration of Xbox 360 fans &#8230;. and I don&#8217;t have one yet. I pre-ordered from EB Games, but I didn&#8217;t pre-order quite soon enough I guess (October), so they haven&#8217;t gotten down to me yet. In fact, they aren&#8217;t even working on the same page of the list yet&#8230; ugh.
