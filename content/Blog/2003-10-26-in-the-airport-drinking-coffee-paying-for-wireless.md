On my way, and I&#8217;m realizing that I have a bit of preperation to do&#8230; this whole trip has been so last minute, and I&#8217;ve been focused on building the web site that will appear at http://msdn.microsoft.com/pdc tomorrow, that I haven&#8217;t even looked at the conference schedule. To be honest, I&#8217;m only barely aware of what hotel I&#8217;m even staying at&#8230; I guess tonight is the night to regroup and make some plans for the week. I hope I can meet up with a ton of folks while I&#8217;m down there&#8230; just email if you are trying to track me down.
