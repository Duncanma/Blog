Marshillboy from Zuneboards.com has [posted a utility that lets you connect your Zune up to multiple PCs as if they were all the &#8216;home' PC](http://www.zuneboards.com/content/view/52/2/). Personally I like the idea, although the main benefit for me would be if it didn't show any UI... right now, the &#8216;hack' pops up its own dialog in place of the Zune one... so I have to click &#8216;Next' either way. Why would I want that?
