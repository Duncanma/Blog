I&#8217;ve obviously been busy, I never even posted a link to these articles here&#8230; I&#8217;ve written two new Xbox Dad article in the past few weeks, <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/liveis5ive/xboxdad.htm" target="_blank" class="broken_link">one all about Xbox Live</a> (to coincide with the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/liveis5ive" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Xbox Live is Five</a> event going on) and <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/personality/xboxdad/2007/1121-vivapartyanimals.htm" target="_blank" class="broken_link">one that I wrote this week about Viva Piñata Party Animals</a>.

<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/splash/v/vivapinatapartyanimals/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Viva Piñata Party</a> is a great game, the &#8216;party&#8217; nature of it means that it is quick to get started, even for non-gamers, and the quick little matches means that you can pick it up and play even if you only have a little bit of time available.
