description: Making sure the work you do, and the impact it has, is visible and understandable to others is one of the most useful skills for anyone in the workforce.

I'm often asked if I have any advice for other software engineers, and
the absolute number one piece of guidance I give is "make sure your work
is visible". Is it the most important thing? No, the most important
things are doing an excellent job and being a positive part of your team, but
**right after** those I would say is "making sure people are aware of
the work you are doing". I get quite a bit of push back on this idea, with
comments such as:

- I prefer to fly under the radar.
- I don't want to brag.
- I've already done the work, why do I also have to tell people about it?

I think many people who resist trying to increase the visibility of their
work misunderstand the reasons why we are doing this, and why it is
important.

Does it help you as an individual? Sure! If your manager and
your company understand all the work you are doing, it could positively
affect your career. That is **one** of the benefits of making your work
visible, but if that isn't appealing to you or if self-promotion feels
wrong, then let's start with the other reasons.

## It helps the manager or company understand how their money is being spent

I know that for salaried employees the link between their time and money
is a bit vague, but it is definitely true that your company has paid you
a sum of money for your work. Shouldn't they understand what they
received for that money? Even if this was Star Trek and you weren't
being paid, there are a certain number of people who only have so much
time in their day, so that finite resource is being 'spent' on your
work. You aren't bragging, you are increasing awareness of the work that
was done and ideally what impact it produced. This will inform future
decisions, determine what kind of work should be done next, what teams
and individuals should be encouraged to continue, or perhaps even given
more funding. If there is a 5 person team, with only 10% of their work
visible, and another team that has 50% of their work visible, it will
seem like that second team is delivering a lot more value. Decisions
will be made based on that information.

In some cases, the result of making everything visible is to discover
that specific work is **not** useful. This is a good result too,
although it may not feel like it when it is your project being
discussed, because then you and the rest of the team end up focused on
the work that matters.

## It ensures you get to spend time on the work that matters

I often hear complaints, sometimes from the same people who push back on
the idea of promoting their work, that the company focuses on the wrong
things, that flashy features often get more attention than critical
infrastructure work, or that "they only see a small bit of the work I
do". All of this is often true, but what are you doing to fix it? If you
want time to be dedicated to focusing on performance work or
infrastructure, or whatever you think is important, then make sure
people know the impact of previous work in those areas. Without
visibility into the work being done, it may seem like everything is just
doing fine with no work needed. Future plans will continue to ignore
these areas, assuming they take no effort and no attention.

## It encourages others to focus on impactful work

Some work, like a new UX feature, is 'self-documenting' as everyone can
see the results, but even then, it is important to explain the impact of
the work. If you want the company (or team) to focus on the right
things, then make sure they are aware of what that is. By building a
habit and a culture around the impact of work, we can avoid a situation
where critical work is avoided because it is less visible and less
rewarding.

It is **easy** for a manager to understand a new UX feature on a web
site, it is harder to understand a deep restructuring of the request
pipeline to improve performance. It is up to you to explain the value of
this work, ideally with metrics showing the impact. If you are lucky,
maybe your manager will do this work for you, selling the higher ups on
your excellent work, but by documenting what you've done, why it is
important, and how it turned out you are making their job so much
easier.

## Putting this into practice

Making work visible isn't just posting a bunch of slack messages
congratulating yourself on shipping something, or sending emails that
just announce that the work has completed. The medium used is probably
specific to your company, but you should craft a story that includes:

- The problem you were trying to solve.
- What you did.
- The impact produced.
- What's next?

You should explain all of this for a broad audience and make the
overall message into a nice self-contained package.

Years ago, my boss at the time Jeff Sandquist, responded to an email of
mine with some great advice. I had sent him a quick note, on top of a
long thread where the dev team was discussing a set of performance
improvements. My message was essentially "we did some good stuff". He
asked me to send him a **'forwardable email'**, which I didn't
understand at all.

After a discussion, it all clicked for me. He wanted a message that
explained the work in a way that he could send to other people in the
company, and they would understand the value of what we had done. This is
harder than what I was used to doing, but way more useful. By wrapping
our work in the context necessary to understand it, including \#s (and
maybe even visuals like screenshots or graphs), it could reach a much
broader audience. By increasing people's understanding of your impact,
you get to influence the conversation about what work is important.

This takes work, but it is essential. Back to the idea of "understanding
what is being paid for", we should always be able to explain the value
of work. If we deploy a new feature, we have to be able to explain why
it is useful and what impact it has had. I would encourage thinking
through the message you'll send, **before and during** the actual project.
If your draft message includes some cool stats, you will know that you
need to be tracking that data, and this often means being able to get a
baseline before your work goes live. The worst feeling is when you've
delivered something that you **know** is super impactful, but you don't
have any data to show it. A major benefit of thinking through this
message from the start is that you might realize that you *can't*
explain why this work is important, which could allow you to change your
plans before putting in all the effort.

By the way, I'm talking about all of this in terms of software
engineering, but that's just because it is my background. This applies
to nearly every form of work I can imagine. In most jobs, you are
spending time on various projects, and the short form of this whole post
is "make people aware of what you are doing and why it is important".
I'm also focused on this from the point of view of the individual doing
the work, but all of the same concepts apply for a manager, making the
work of their team visible.

## Finally, it really is helpful for you as an individual

You aren't a stealth bomber, and management isn't the enemy, so stop
flying under the radar. In a perfect world, people would just do the
work and be recognized for it, but in reality you have to work to ensure
that work is seen and understood. Don't fake it, and don't take credit
for other people's work (in fact, working hard to ensure other people's
work is visible is a great idea), we aren't trying to game the system.
We just want everyone to be aware of what is being done. If you see
someone who's work is always getting recognized more than yours,
consider what they might be doing to make that happen and learn from it.
