[Chris just got back from Disney, Sea World, etc](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=1207){.broken_link}&#8230; [Brian](http://weblogs.asp.net/brianjo/){.broken_link} heads there (Disneyworld in his case) this weekend, the site manager for C#, Amy, is going to Disneyland this weekend&#8230;. and I&#8217;m heading [there](http://disneyland.disney.go.com/dlr/landing/parkDLP) next week&#8230;

All this, and nary a mention of the mouse from anyone on my team in my last two years at MSDN.
