If I told you that I was a recovering alcholic, would you offer me a drink? I doubt it, unless you are a real bastard. Well, <a href="http://www.adamkinney.com" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Adam Kinney</a> (my boss at <a href="http://on10.net" target="_blank" class="broken_link">on10.net</a>) and I have been having many discussions about RPGs and MMORPGs (<a href="http://adamkinney.com/blog/130/default.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Oblivion</a>, Asheron&#8217;s Call and WoW being the main topics). I told him that I used to play a ton of AC, but I found that it was a real drain on my time and that I finally had to quit it so that I could stop spending my nights up until 2 am playing&#8230; so what does he do? He sends me a free 10-day trial to WoW.
