I went over to 360Style.net today to find that it has been totally redesigned&#8230; same great content, much easier to find your way around. While I was there I picked up <a href="http://www.360style.net/wallpapers28.html" target="_blank" class="broken_link">a new background for my Vista box</a>. The wallpapers that ship with Vista are beautiful, but they can&#8217;t compare with this&#8230;
