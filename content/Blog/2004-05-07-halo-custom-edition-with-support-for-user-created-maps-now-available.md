I heard this was coming in a few weeks, but it is [here now](http://gbxforums.gearboxsoftware.com//showflat.php?Cat=&Board=Halo&Number=181661&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5&o=&fpart=1){.broken_link}&#8230;.

This is a free download, but note that you have to have your original CD-Key for this to work&#8230;. and that the version that supports custom maps is multi-player only and doesn&#8217;t ship with any of the original maps&#8230; the dedicated server program is included though!!

&nbsp;

[Update: Note sure about that &#8216;doesn&#8217;t ship with maps&#8217; comment I made&#8230; I read that in an article on the web, but the maps appeared to be there when I played&#8230; perhaps the new maps added in Halo PC are missing&#8230; but I can&#8217;t be sure]
