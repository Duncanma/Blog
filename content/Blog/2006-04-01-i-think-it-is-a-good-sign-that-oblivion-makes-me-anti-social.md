So, another blog post in my series about how much I&#8217;m enjoying Oblivion&#8230; I really want to buy Blazing Angels, but it seems pointless to get it right now&#8230; I know I won&#8217;t play it. At this point, I probably haven&#8217;t play anywhere nearly as much as a more dedicated (some one with no children, and without a job that tends to lead to working in the evening?) gamer. But I&#8217;m still having a great time. I have just one character at this point (I&#8217;ll probably go back and start again eventually), a level 8 dark-elf archer who spends way too much time using his sword instead of his bow.

Oblivion thought of the day: Man **Savage Trolls** are annoying!
