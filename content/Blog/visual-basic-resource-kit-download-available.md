We've updated the page with the download URL already (some fast work on the part of our site team there), so you might want to go back and check it out...

<http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/vbrkit/>



If you aren't already using some form of download manager, I'd like to humbly suggest you try out my app from <http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/using/columns/code4fun/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun02282003.asp>

It won't pull it down amazingly fast (it tries to avoid using up a lot of your CPU and bandwidth if you are using the machine) but it will retry and retry even across restarts... just fire up the app again to check status.
