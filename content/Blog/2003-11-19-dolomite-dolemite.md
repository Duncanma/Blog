Earlier today I posted some background pics&#8230; including some from <a href="www.dolomitesworld.com" target="_blank" class="broken_link">www.dolomitesworld.com</a>&#8230; Frank Redmond (Content Strategist for .NET Framework) just bust out laughing in my office because he thought I was posting backgrounds based on one of the many wonderful Dolemite films&#8230;
