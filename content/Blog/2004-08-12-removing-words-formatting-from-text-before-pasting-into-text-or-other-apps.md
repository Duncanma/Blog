The age-old question of &#8216;how do I avoid putting funky Office HTML into my blog postings&#8217; came up on an internal email list today, and one of the answers was a pointer to <a href="http://stevemiller.net/PureText/" target="_blank">http://stevemiller.net/PureText/</a>, which I had never heard of&#8230; but it looks cool!

> _&#8220;Have you ever copied some text from a web page, a word document, help, etc., and wanted to paste it as simple text into another application without getting all the formatting from the original source? PureText makes this simple. Just copy/cut whatever you want to the clipboard, click on the PureText tray icon, and then paste to any application. Better yet, you can configure a Hot-Key to convert and paste the text for you. The pasted text will be pure and free from all formatting.&#8221;_
