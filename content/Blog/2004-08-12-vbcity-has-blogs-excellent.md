Serge Baranovsky, the man behind <a href="http://vbcity.com/" target="_blank">vbCity</a>, just mentioned to me that they have started hosting blogs&#8230; just their staff at the moment, but they have plans to grow&#8230; Since vbCity is already one of the best sites for VB developers, this is good news!
