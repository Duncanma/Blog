_Note that this **is not** a prototype of the next version of MSDN&#8230; it is intended to be consumed by the internal browser in Visual Studio&#8230; so the non-IE issues mentioned in the comments and the lack of index/search/etc&#8230; are really non-issues considering how this material is intended to be used. I post it only to give a little bit more Whidbey information to folks who haven&#8217;t installed the Community previews&#8230;. using it through a normal browser may not provide the greatest experience at this point ðŸ™‚_
