I&#8217;ve put up a new poll on my site:

> <a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/" target="_blank">What type of database do you use for the majority of your applications?</a>



If your answer is &#8220;something not on this list&#8221;, why don&#8217;t you post a comment on this blog entry to let me know what item was missing from my list?
