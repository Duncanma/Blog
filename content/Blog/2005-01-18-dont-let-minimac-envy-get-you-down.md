Just saw <a href="http://www.4xem.com/products.php?category=15" target="_blank" class="broken_link">this</a>, a whole list of MiniMac sized PCs&#8230;. maybe Mac folks would say it isn&#8217;t about the size, it is about <a href="http://www.furrygoat.com/2005/01/pleasure_and_th.html" target="_blank" class="broken_link">the experience</a>&#8230; but I&#8217;m sure the size matters to some degree.
