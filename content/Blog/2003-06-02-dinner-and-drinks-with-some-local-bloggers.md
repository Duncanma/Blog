A pair of Mr. Smiths ([Eric](http://weblogs.asp.net/ericjsmith/) and [Cory](http://addressof.com/blog/)) have invited me and anyone else who is into .NET to come for dinner and drinks at the [Hard Rock Cafe](http://www.hardrock.com/locations/cafes/Cafes.aspx?Lc=DALL) in Dallas&#8230; 7 pm Tuesday night.

I&#8217;ll be there, and I hope to see a few more folks too!
