This got me to thinking about a book that I used to spend hours and hours reading, I probably read it through cover-to-cover over a hundred times over the years&#8230; and a few searches later I found the title and author, Roy A. Gallant, &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0870443569/duncanmackenz-20" target="_blank">Our Universe</a>&#8220;&#8230; but it wasn&#8217;t until I found a picture of the book&#8217;s cover that I was sure it was the same one.

I probably spent most of my reading time in all my various &#8216;youth fiction&#8217;, like Piers Anthony&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345347536/duncanmackenz-20" target="_blank">Xanth</a> series, but the runner up would be the World Book encyclopedia set my parents had bought&#8230; it was the place I learned all about <a href="http://europeanhistory.about.com/library/weekly/aa070601a.htm" target="_blank">the Maginot Line</a>, for example&#8230; and various picture-filled books like this one and others on World War II aircraft, etc&#8230; so many things to look at and to fill your head with thoughts.

Of course, I&#8217;m a geek, so we&#8217;ll have Encarta around, but I just don&#8217;t think you can beat the enjoyment of a full-color oversized book to dig into a topic
