<img src="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/images/JapaneseLanguageFeeds.png" align="right" />Perhaps a little bug left over from when they first launched in Japan, but the MSN Spaces feeds seem to specify a language code for at least one english language feed (<a href="http://www.bufferoverrun.net" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Brian&#8217;s</a>)&#8230; but it does return en-US for some others. Hmm&#8230; it also seems to specify en-US for <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/godpapa123/" target="_blank">some feeds</a> that are quite obviously not&#8230; perhaps choosing your language is a per-blog setting that people aren&#8217;t aware of? I&#8217;m not sure if it matters all that much, other than to blog indexers, if the character set and encoding is correct, the lanugage element isn&#8217;t really important to aggregators or browsers, but since it changes from feed to feed it must be based on some sort of per-blog or per-user setting.
