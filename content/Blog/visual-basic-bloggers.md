title: Visual Basic bloggers
type: posts
---
As some folks may know, [I](https://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/letters) come up with the content for the Visual Basic developer center on MSDN (<http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic>) and I'm going to list some blogs on a sub-page of the site... starting with a small list, but hopefully growing it with some feedback from the community at large. I'm interested in blogs that contain useful information for Visual Basic (.NET or not) developers. I was going to start with:

  * [Paul Vick](https://www.panopticoncentral.net)
  * [3 Leaf (Early & Adopter)](https://radio.weblogs.com/0117167/)
  * [Brad Abrams](https://blogs.gotdotnet.com/BradA/)
  * [ShowUsYourCode](https://weblogs.asp.net/dneimke/)
  * [Chris Brumme](https://blogs.gotdotnet.com/cbrumme/)
  * Whoops, forgot [Keith Pleas](https://weblogs.asp.net/kpleas/) on my clipboard ðŸ™‚
  * Likely [weblogs.asp.net](https://weblogs.asp.net) and [blogs.gotdotnet.com](https://blogs.gotdotnet.com) in general

Although this is **not** intended to be a complete list of all useful blogs... (that would quickly become unusable as a page on the site), but if you have any suggestions for blogs to list on the VB developer center (or comments on the ones I have listed), please let me know!
