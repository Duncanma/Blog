[<img style="margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px;" border="0" align="left" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51iQXUWYI6L._SY90_.jpg" />](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0143038257?tag=duncanmackenz-20&camp=0&creative=0&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=0143038257&adid=0V4A0CSRV4GS0GNJ1VY6&) One positive side to being stuck at home for two weeks is that I was able to do a fair bit more reading. For the most part, I read magazines and watched movies, but my wife also brought me the book &ldquo;Three Cups of Tea&rdquo; about Greg Mortenson&rsquo;s work in Pakistan building schools for the children of poor rural areas. Mr. Mortenson, an avid mountain climber, ended up spending time in a small village near the base of K2 in Pakistan, barely making it down alive after a failed attempt to reach the summit. Spending time with those people made quite an affect on him and from that point on he was on a mission to build schools and otherwise help out the people of that area. The book is great reading, dealing with exciting events, perilous adventures and important issues &hellip; all taking place in an area of the world that is completely foreign to many of us.
