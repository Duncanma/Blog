For quite some time I&#8217;ve thought Pageviews were a mostly useless number to be tracking for any web site. This was very clear at [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com), where such stats are tracked very carefully&#8230; spreadsheets are created&#8230; charts are made&#8230; and yet, none of us really believed in the Pageview #s. Instead we used to focus more on unique visitors or an odd calculated value we called unique page views (not everyone&#8217;s definition of that # is the same, but suffice it to say that is an attempt to more accurately represent real site visits by real people).

RSS is one reason why PageViews are useless, site design considerations are another (if high page views are a goal, then reducing the # of clicks for a user to get from your home page to an article becomes a bad thing&#8230; when it should a wonderful thing).

I found <a href="http://evhead.com/2006/08/pageviews-are-obsolete.asp" target="_blank">a great article today</a>, via <a href="http://del.icio.us/alexbarn" target="_blank">Alex Barnett&#8217;s deli.cio.us links</a>, on this exact topic.
