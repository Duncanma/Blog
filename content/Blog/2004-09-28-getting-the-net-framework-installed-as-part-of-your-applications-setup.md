I&#8217;m working on the bootstrapper chapter for my upcoming ClickOnce book and it occured to me that a lot of people probably haven&#8217;t heard about the bootstrapper for Visual Studio .NET 2003&#8230;

> The Visual Studio .NET Framework Bootstrapper Plug-in modifies the behavior of the Setup project&#8217;s Bootstrapper property to include the .NET Framework bootstrapper as well as the Windows Installer bootstrapper. 

Got a .NET app? Need to get the Framework onto the user&#8217;s machine? Check out the bootstrapper!!
