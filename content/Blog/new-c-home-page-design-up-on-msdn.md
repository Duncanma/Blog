We've been playing with some new developer center home page designs, and we decided to update the C# site first. Check it out at [http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/" target="_blank) and let me know what you think...

Of special interest to the blogging folks, notice that my blog is right on the home page... so expect regular C# updates feeding through weblogs.asp.net right onto MSDN.
