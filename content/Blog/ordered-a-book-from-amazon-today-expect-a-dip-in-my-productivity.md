I remembered that [the <b>11th</b> book in the Wheel of Time series](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/0312873077&link_code=as2&camp=1789&tag=duncanmackenz-20&creative=9325" target="_blank), Knife of Dreams, [<img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0312873077.01._AA_SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg" align="right" border="0" />](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/0312873077&link_code=as2&camp=1789&tag=duncanmackenz-20&creative=9325)was coming out sometime in October so I checked for it on Amazon today and it turns out it came out on the 19th. So (despite being fairly busy and having a real problem with reading non-stop through every single book I get the moment it shows up) I ordered it. Maybe I can get it in time for my trip down to [DevConnections in Las Vegas in November](http://www.devconnections.com/shows/aspfall2005/default.asp?s=65" target="_blank), then I can read it on the plane and in the hotel, it would help keep me out of trouble.
