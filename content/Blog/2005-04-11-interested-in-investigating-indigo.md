<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/scottseely" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Scott Seely</a>, a former MSDN co-worker of mine and now a member of the Indigo team, is working on a new Indigo book with Brian Nantz. The book won&#8217;t be out for a while, but you can get a lot of advance information (including some of the chapters), by watching for updates on <a href="http://www.thatindigobook.com" target="_blank">www.thatindigobook.com</a>. Should be a great way to get a free taste of some Indigo content right from someone who works on the code&#8230;
