I was pretty impressed with the [first Roku offering](http://www.rokulabs.com/products/hd1000/index.php){.broken_link}, a HDTV focused media player that included &#8220;art packs&#8221; to use your HDTV flat panel as artwork&#8230; not that I have one of those flat LCD or Plasma displays&#8230; but the idea was appealing. Now they&#8217;ve come out with the [Soundbridge](http://www.rokulabs.com/products/soundbridge/index.php){.broken_link} (a networked audio device) and I&#8217;m impressed again.

Disclaimer: I haven&#8217;t actually _seen_ either of these products, just the specs on the site, but the feature set and design are interesting.
