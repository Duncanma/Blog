 <font face="Trebuchet MS" color="teal">on IsNumeric has resulted in a few comments&#8230;<br /> and I just need to chime in here, use Microsoft.VisualBasic! It is all IL in the<br /> end, right? This topic comes up over and over again on </font>

<font face="Trebuchet MS" color="teal">, and I just<br /> want it to go away! Almost always, someone writes up and posts a C#<br /> implementation of IsNumeric that might be useful, but it is not equivalent to<br /> the function from this assembly. Why write your own, incorrect or incomplete,<br /> implementation when a highly-tested one is shipping with the Framework? Are you<br /> going to do the same for all of the functions in the Framework?</font> 

<font face="Trebuchet MS" color="teal"><strong>Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll</strong> is an assembly, it ships<br /> with .NET, it provides useful functions&#8230; the decision to use it or not<br /> shouldn&#8217;t be any more difficult than deciding if you are going to use any other<br /> useful assembly. If you dig into the IL and you don&#8217;t like what it does, fine&#8230;<br /> but I hope you are applying the same standard to all of the libraries you<br /> use.</font>
