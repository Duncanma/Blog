And I&#8217;m not trying to be casual&#8230; stupid thing is, I went for a run on Monday as part of a &#8220;Boot Camp&#8221; group fitness program, and it was probably my longest run in the last 12 years&#8230; and now my foot is just killing me when I put on my normal shoes. Turns out, when I put my running shoes back on it feels fine, but I&#8217;m not a fan of wearing running shoes with my regular work clothes so I went all out today and put on track pants and a T-shirt (along with my comfortable shoes, of course). Likely, my co-workers will just assume I ran out of clean clothes ðŸ™‚
