I&#8217;ve received a few emails and blog comments wondering how to submit comments on the [MSDN C# Developer Center](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp), suggestions for new comments, etc. so I thought I would quickly mention that anyone who has any comment at all about the site should feel free to [email me](mailto:duncanma@microsoft.com). There is also a <a href="http://register.microsoft.com/contactus30/contactus.asp?domain=msdn" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Contact Us</a> link on each page of MSDN if you have any comments that go beyond the C# developer center itself.
