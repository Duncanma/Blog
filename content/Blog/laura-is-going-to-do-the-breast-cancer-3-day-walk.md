> The Breast Cancer 3-Day is a 60-mile walk over the course of three days. Net proceeds benefit Susan G. Komen for the Cure and the National Philanthropic Trust, funding important breast cancer research, education, screening, and treatment.

Laura will be walking for 3-days, and I'll be hanging out with the kids... we all must do our part ðŸ™‚
