<font face="Trebuchet MS" color="teal">Get certified.. it is cool to have the<br /> option to use the letters, but more importantly it can (1) give a little bit of<br /> reassurance to someone who is a 1st time client of yours&#8230; how could that be<br /> bad? and (2) it reassures you that &#8220;yep, I do know at least that much&#8230;&#8221;.<br /> Sometimes I&#8217;ve thought&#8230; &#8220;Maybe my programming assignments have all been easy,<br /> and I&#8217;m not actually even in the league of person x&#8221; &#8230; at least with an MCSD I<br /> felt that I must have some idea what I&#8217;m doing ðŸ™‚</font>

<font face="Trebuchet MS" color="teal">I passed those WOSA tests, which I<br /> thought were useful tests to&nbsp;a certain degree (developers should have a<br /> good knowledge of the underlying OS and hardware&#8230; maybe not those specific<br /> details Keith mentioned, but the intent of the exams was valid) .. and received<br /> my MCSD in 1996. Big deal at the time, but I&#8217;m still proud of it. I kept it up<br /> to date and added a MCSE (NT4) and MCT &#8230; but&nbsp;recently I&#8217;ve realized that<br /> I&#8217;ll likely be certificationless soon (NT4 MCSE&#8230; MCT expired because I don&#8217;t<br /> teach anymore, MCSD is for VB6&#8230;) if I don&#8217;t get back on the exam taking track.<br /> Why bother?&nbsp;At this point, with a job that doesn&#8217;t require it of me,<br /> I&nbsp;want to do&nbsp;it to help out the certification itself by pointing out<br /> that I am proud to have it. If I ever manage to get my certifications<br /> up-to-date, I&#8217;d like to list them in that little bio they put at the end of my<br /> columns.</font>

<font face="Trebuchet MS" color="teal">I actually suggested (when I first<br /> arrived at MSDN)&nbsp;that we list certifications after the names of all our<br /> writers, to show the developer community that our &#8216;experts&#8217; valued their<br /> certifications&#8230; but not all of us had our MCSD so we decided it&nbsp;wouldn&#8217;t<br /> have the desired effect.&nbsp;I had just come to Redmond from a position out &#8220;in<br /> the field&#8221; working for Microsoft Consulting Services and the customers I worked<br /> with were (and still are) of the opinion that certification was very valuable.<br /> Anyways, in the end my general answer to anyone who says that they don&#8217;t need to<br /> be certified is &#8220;why not, how can it hurt?&#8221;</font>

<font face="Trebuchet MS" color="teal">Sure you don&#8217;t need it, but then it<br /> should be easy for you to blow through the exams&#8230; I&#8217;d hate to have a customer<br /> ask me if I was an MCSD and have to say no&#8230; &#8220;I don&#8217;t need it&#8221; might not cut it<br /> with them. Does having a MCSE/D prove you are an expert? Of course not, but it<br /> proves a certain level of basic knowledge&#8230; you can prove the rest through your<br /> references and your work.</font>
