> Every year at Microsoft there is a little internal-only conference where Microsoft Research (MSR) shows off their projects. It is very cool but very private (badges checked at the door, etc...). Well, this year it is a bit different... For [MSR TechFest 2007](http://research.microsoft.com/aboutmsr/techfest/default.aspx" target="_blank) they've allowed folks to come in and interview the researchers, take pictures/video, whatever... crazy stuff and you get to see the results first on Channel 9.  [Rory](http://www.neopoleon.com/home/default.aspx" target="_blank) tours us around, gives us an intro to the whole event and even covers a couple of projects... and this is just the first of the series!
