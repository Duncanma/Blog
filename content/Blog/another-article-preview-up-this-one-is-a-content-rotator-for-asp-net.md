As I discussed in [an earlier post](http://weblogs.asp.net/duncanma/archive/2004/08/05/209654.aspx" target="_blank), I wanted to know if people found preview articles useful... and at least a few people said they did, so here is another one....

Feedback, via the blog or the feedback link at the bottom of [the article page](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/writing/Previews/ContentRotator/default.aspx" target="_blank), is always welcome!
