> In a previous entry, I received a comment about how there were no examples of using WebDAV in the Exchange SDK with ASP.Net&#8230; I forwarded it to our SDK team (who can be reached at exsdkfb AT microsoft DOT com) and they pointed out several examples for me:
> 
>   * Searching Folders (WebDAV) &#8211; C# and VB.Net
>   * Sending a Message (WebDAV) &#8211; C# and VB.Net
>   * Getting the Size of a Mailbox (WebDAV) &#8211; C# and VB.Net
>   * The Notifications Sample Application &#8211; C#
> 
> If you would like to request any more managed code samples in the SDK, drop them a line at [the email address above](http://blogs.msdn.com/kclemson/contact.aspx){.broken_link}, or add a comment to this entry and I will forward it on.
