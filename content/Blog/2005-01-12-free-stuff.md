I read [this PVP cartoon](http://www.pvponline.com/archive.php3?archive=20050109" target="_blank) last week, talking about the free iPod thing, and now I've seen similar things (free dvds, free pcs, free video games, etc...) from the [same company](http://www.gratisnetwork.com/default.html" target="_blank). After reading [about it](http://www.engadget.com/entry/1771223899144212" target="_blank), **I gave in**.

I signed up for the Columbia deal personally, though the blockbuster offer seems &#8216;free-er' ... the whole thing is probably another one of those "sign up for the free offer, because we know you are too lazy to remember to cancel before we start charging you money" deals... so check it out at your own risk ðŸ™‚

Here is **my** [link to the flat screen offer](http://www.freeflatscreens.com/?r=13882371" target="_blank)... [and one to the MiniMac offer](http://www.freeminimacs.com/?r=13892191" target="_blank) **which add to my referral count**, and here is a normal, no codes, link in case you'd rather [check it out without any baggage](http://www.freeflatscreens.com/" target="_blank). ðŸ™‚
