I just read the description of this game on [xbox.com](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/ninjagaiden/default.htm){.broken_link}, which I've done before ... then I read "Nov 2003" for a ship date. I swear I actually shivered... oooh. 

Turns out, according to EBGames.com at least, that it is 12/15/2003... which is the day before I go away from my XBox for 3 weeks... but I'm still excited!
