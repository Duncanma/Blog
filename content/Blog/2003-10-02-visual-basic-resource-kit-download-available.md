We&#8217;ve updated the page with the download URL already (some fast work on the part of our site team there), so you might want to go back and check it out&#8230;

If you aren&#8217;t already using some form of download manager, I&#8217;d like to humbly suggest you try out my app from <http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/using/columns/code4fun/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun02282003.asp>{.broken_link}

It won&#8217;t pull it down amazingly fast (it tries to avoid using up a lot of your CPU and bandwidth if you are using the machine) but it will retry and retry even across restarts&#8230; just fire up the app again to check status.
