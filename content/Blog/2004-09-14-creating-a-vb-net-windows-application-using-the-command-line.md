so I posted up a sample to <a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/samples/commandline/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">the samples page on my personal site</a> that shows creating two programs via the VB.NET command line compiler&#8230; first a console application, then a Windows Forms app&#8230; this page is a draft version of something I&#8217;m putting together for MSDN so let me know if you find it useful&#8230;
