Hitting this page (<a href="http://www.voodoopc.com/showroom.aspx?productID=1076" target="_blank" class="broken_link">http://www.voodoopc.com/showroom.aspx?productID=1076</a>) with IE7 produces several javascript alerts letting me know that I&#8217;m running an &#8220;Old Browser&#8221;. Now, I&#8217;m assuming that this is a bug in their version detection code, but even so&#8230; is that what they show to someone running Netscape 4 or IE 5&#8230; &#8220;Old Browser&#8221; ? Odd&#8230;.
