    <b> [Chats on Visual Basic 2005](http://blogs.msdn.com/vbteam/archive/2004/07/07/175635.aspx) </b> <em> For the past year, I've been organizing the Visual Basic chats that appear at </em> [ <em>http://msdn.microsoft.com/chats/</em> ](http://msdn.microsoft.com/chats/) <em>.

    <em>Naturally, now that the Beta 1 for Visual Basic 2005 is available, I wanted to schedule some chats to answer your Beta questions. But after discussing this with Robert Green, we decided to change the format somewhat; instead of just answering questions, the chat hosts will also be looking for feedback about what you like (or don't like) about the selected feature....</em>
