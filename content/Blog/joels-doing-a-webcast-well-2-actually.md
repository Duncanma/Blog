[Joel Semeniuk](http://weblogs.asp.net/Jsemeniuk/), (my former roommate, co-founder of my first software development company, and now a co-founder of [Imaginets](http://www.Imaginets.com)), is doing [a security webcast for MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/security/understanding/webcasts/)... something about &#8216;threat modeling' or &#8216;model threatening', I'm really not sure which, but I'm sure it will be entertaining either way.
