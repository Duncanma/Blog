I saw a newsgroup post (by Todd Bowra) that an update was available for my XBox media center extender, but I can&#8217;t find anything about this on any of the media center sites on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com" target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com</a> or xbox.com, so I thought I would spread the word via my blog ðŸ™‚

> For those of you who have been patiently waiting for Update Rollup 1 for Media Center Extender for Xbox (aka &#8220;the restricted content update&#8221;), the wait is now over. This afternoon, Update Rollup 1 was released via Xbox Live and simultaneously made available on disc for users who do not have Xbox Live. Summarized details are below.
