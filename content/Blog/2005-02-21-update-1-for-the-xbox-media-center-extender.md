I saw a newsgroup post (by Todd Bowra) that an update was available for my XBox media center extender, but I can't find anything about this on any of the media center sites on [http://www.microsoft.com](http://www.microsoft.com" target="_blank) or xbox.com, so I thought I would spread the word via my blog ðŸ™‚

> For those of you who have been patiently waiting for Update Rollup 1 for Media Center Extender for Xbox (aka "the restricted content update"), the wait is now over. This afternoon, Update Rollup 1 was released via Xbox Live and simultaneously made available on disc for users who do not have Xbox Live. Summarized details are below.

> If you have MCX for Xbox and are an Xbox Live user, you will be prompted to update your MCX software next time you log in to Live. Once the update has been installed, you will be prompted to add your MCX to your Media Center again, which you can accomplish by following the below steps:
>
> &#8211; On your Media Center PC, launch the MCX Manager (Start &#8211;> All Programs &#8211;> Accessories &#8211;> Media Center &#8211;> Media Center Extender Manager)
> &#8211; Select File &#8211;> Add a new Extender...
> &#8211; Type in the 8-digit code displayed on the TV your Xbox is connected to
>
> Note: if you download Update Rollup 1 from Xbox Live, you will also need to install updated PC-side software to enable the functionality noted under Changes. You may obtain this software via the link noted under "Obtaining Update Rollup 1: users without Xbox Live". Note that you will not need to install additional PC software if you have already installed the MCX set top box update (available via [http://www.microsoft.com/ windowsxp/mediacenter/evaluation /devices/support.mspx](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/evaluation/devices/support.mspx" target="_blank)).
