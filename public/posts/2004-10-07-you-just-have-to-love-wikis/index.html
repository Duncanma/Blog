<p>Wikis seem to be nothing but free space for spammers&#8230; yes, yes&#8230; I know.. <a href="http://www.pinvoke.net" target="_blank">they have good aspects</a>, but it seems whenever I get a link to a wiki, the odds I&#8217;m going to see what I expected are very low (and the odds of seeing farm animals in disturbing poses is high).</p>

<p>Today I decided to click on a link to see screenshots of GTK#, the UI engine in Mono, and they decided to post these shots onto a Wiki. No idea why they would do that, they certainly are capable of posting HTML to their own web sites, but whatever&#8230; I <a href="http://www.nullenvoid.com/gtksharp/wiki/index.php/ScreenShots" target="_blank" class="broken_link">clicked on the link</a> and spent a few minutes trying to figure out what the hell I was looking at. Turns out someone filled the page with link spam, <strong>deleting the content that was there</strong>. Looking back through the page history I was able to find <a href="http://www.nullenvoid.com/gtksharp/wiki/index.php/ScreenShots?version=31" target="_blank" class="broken_link">the real content</a>, but I also got to see that this was <a href="http://www.nullenvoid.com/gtksharp/wiki/index.php/ScreenShots?action=PageHistory&version=31" target="_blank" class="broken_link">at least the 3rd or 4th time</a> they had to restore their content after it had been destroyed by spammers.</p>
