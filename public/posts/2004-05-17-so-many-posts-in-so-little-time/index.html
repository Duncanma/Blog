      After that I found myself responding to several posters about design decisions we made and the usefulness of the library we&#8217;d written. I figured it was kind of silly to be having these conversations in the feedback section of another blog (especially as we were starting to branch out onto new topics). So it seemed natural to start my own blog at this point.
