The pace is slower than most adult/teen games, but that makes it into more of an exploration instead of just quickly moving from one task to the next. My wife watched it and thought it was similar to a much more interactive and complex form of the game Myst&#8230; there are some action elements where you have to move quickly, target the bad guys, etc&#8230; but for the most part you are figuring out puzzles, perfecting your spells and exploring a very open set of environments."/>
