    <p>Last year I managed to go from 205-ish down to around 175 â€¦ just by following the South Beach Diet and working out more consistently (shooting for 5 days a week, generally hit 4 at least)â€¦ but then I switched jobs to work on a new project (<a href="http://on10.net">http://on10.net</a>{.broken_link}, a site that has featured Chris a few times) and totally fell off the wagon. Now Iâ€™m 187 (for months Iâ€™ve been putting 180 into the treadmill, but I actually weighed myself Monday night) and Iâ€™m really depressed about it. Iâ€™m actually thinking it is responsible for a general down-turn in my whole mood, about just about everything, so I think I need to do something about it.</p>

<p>By BMI terms, I believe I need to be 150 pounds (and yes, I know the BMI isnâ€™t always right, etc&#8230; but it is a pretty good measure for most folks I think) and that is a fair ways down there. I attended an informational meeting today about the <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> program that I can join at our local health club (<a href="http://proclub.com/default.aspx?tabid=673)">http://proclub.com/default.aspx?tabid=673)</a> and Iâ€™m considering itâ€¦ insurance will cover most of it, but it is still going to cost me around $2000 dollars, something I donâ€™t really have at the moment. Funny thing is, if I lose some weight on my own I&#8217;ll fall below the BMI # required to get my health insurance to cover any of the program and the cost will go way up (wouldn&#8217;t that be silly&#8230; lose some weight while thinking about the program and end up ineligible ðŸ™‚ ).</p>

<p>Hmph&#8230;</p>
