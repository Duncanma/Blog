<p><a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/blog/laura-is-going-to-do-the-breast-cancer-3-day-walk/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">My wife is going to be in the 3-Day walk for Breast Cancer</a> and I thought it might be useful to build a widget to display your donation info on a website. So if you are going to walk in the event, or if you know someone who is, then you might be interested in this.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To get this</p>

<p>Just add this text to your page:</p>

<p><code>&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/ThreeDay.ashx?donationurl=http://www.the3day.org/Seattle07/lauramackenzie&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></p>

<p>(replace the donation url with the link for the appropriate person&#8230; or leave it as Laura&#8217;s&nbsp;ðŸ™‚ )</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note that I haven&#8217;t tested this with anyone else&#8217;s page, so please let me know how it works for you.</p>
