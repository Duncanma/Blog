    <p>I started writing this entry about &#8220;Giving advice on technology to friends and family&#8230;&#8221;, but I realized after I had rambled on for a bit, that it was more about technology decisions&#8230; when companies force us to decide between MP3 and WMA or iTunes and WMP or even Super Audio CD and DVD-Audio or Blu-Ray DVD vs. HD-DVD&#8230; in every case, there will generally be a wrong decision that you can make. I hate that situation, it can stop me dead in my tracks from adopting a technology altogether&#8230;</p>

<p>As is probably true for most of the people who read this blog, people often ask me for advice about</p>

<p>technical matters, even things that I have no real training or credentials in. Case in point, it seems</p>

<p>everyone these days is asking me what type of music player to buy (MP3/WMA player that is). I guess</p>

<p>that is a sign of widespread adoption, when even the non-gadget folks are getting into a technology, but</p>

<p>being a computer-related gadget, I&#8217;m automatically assumed to know what I&#8217;m talking about. Well, I</p>

<p>certainly have my opinions, and I know a fair bit about how it all works, but I have to be honest and tell</p>

<p>you that I haven&#8217;t really spent much time looking at the &#8216;other&#8217; side of the world in terms of music</p>

<p>players. When someone first asked me what player they should buy, I decided that I needed to look into</p>

<p>the various <a href="http://www.FreeiPodShuffle.com/?r=14790940" target="_blank">iPods</a> so that I could consider them as options, but I was very puzzled by what I found. I had</p>

<p>assumed a few things that turned out to be incorrect. I knew that iTunes was focused on MP3, and I</p>

<p>knew that it didn&#8217;t support WMA, but I had no idea that it only supported one family of devices (iPods). I</p>

<p>was also surprised to learn that there wasn&#8217;t any real alternatives to iTunes for putting music onto those</p>

<p>devices as well.</p>

<p>Personally, these facts ended up being a deal-killer for me&#8230; I couldn&#8217;t recommend an iPod to</p>

<p>anyone in my family without worrying that they would end up unhappy in the end. Now, don&#8217;t get me</p>

<p>wrong, iPods seem great and wonderful and I am 100% sure that anyone in my family who tried one</p>

<p>would like it&#8230; but things change over time and they eventually may want to buy another device. At that</p>

<p>point, after they&#8217;ve put all their music into iTunes and when they know no other way to work with digital</p>

<p>music, what choice will they have? Can they buy a Rio device and sync it with iTunes (without using</p>

<p>hacks&#8230; that is definitely not mother-friendly)? By recommending an iPod for a single christmas</p>

<p>purchase, I would be locking them into one set of software and hardware for a very long time. Instead, I</p>

<p>end up looking around at <a href="http://www.mp3players4free.com/default.aspx?r=206786" target="_blank" class="broken_link">all the other options</a> (Rio, iRiver, Creative, Samsung). These devices work with both</p>

<p>WMA and MP3 (and some work with other formats as well) and they work with multiple media players,</p>

<p>including but not limited to Windows Media Player. So, if I recommend a Rio today, and they decide</p>

<p>they want the new &#8220;brand x&#8221; player in 3 years&#8230; odds are they won&#8217;t have a problem just syncing their</p>

<p>existing music files with that new device, probably with the same software&#8230;</p>

<p>It ends up being a dilemma for me though, knowing that I have unreconcilable differences with a line</p>

<p>of devices/software that is very popular and may well be the current market leader, and still trying to</p>

<p>provide folks who ask with the best possible advice. I&#8217;ve had this problem before though, where I have</p>

<p>fundamental issues with a brand or product, but other factors keep forcing it back into my list of likely</p>

<p>choices. Sony has always been that way for me. I love their stuff, I always look at them first for TVs and</p>

<p>audio equipment&#8230; I have a Sony camera, a Sony TV, a Sony camcorder, a Sony stereo and CD</p>

<p>changer in my car, etc&#8230; but they don&#8217;t support WMA and that is a pain in the butt for me&#8230; since all my</p>

<p>music is already ripped into that format. So when it is time to buy a new car stereo (my current one is a</p>

<p>bit smashed up from a failed burglary attempt), I&#8217;ve decided that it makes sense to get one with WMA</p>

<p>support&#8230; and yet I keep looking at the Sony models.</p>

<p>It is a sickness perhaps.</p>

<p>My brother asked me a few years ago if a Sony &#8220;network walkman&#8221; would be a good digital music player and I said that it was a</p>

<p>Sony&#8230; it would probably be great. Horrible mistake. The software that came with it forced you to</p>

<p>&#8216;check-out&#8217; music to put it onto the player&#8230; then you had to check it back in (removing it off the player) if</p>

<p>you wanted to use it on your computer. Windows Media Player could work with the player in certain</p>

<p>circumstances involving weird driver and device configuration, and then you could sync files like &#8216;normal&#8217;,</p>

<p>but my brother never managed to get anything other than the Sony software working. He has a Rio now,</p>

<p>a little 64mb job that he was able to expand using SD cards, and he has been much happier&#8230; although</p>

<p>the Sony device certainly looked nicer. In the end though, I&#8217;m still easily tempted by Sony; I saw that</p>

<p>they had a new digital music player and I clicked on <a href="http://www.sonystyle.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/en/-/USD/SY_DisplayProductInformation-Start?ProductSKU=NWE99&#038;Dept=audio&#038;CategoryName=pa_flashMemory" target="_blank">the link</a> in seconds, even though I&#8217;ll never buy it.</p>

<p>Whenever I decide to spend the money on a new car stereo (it still works, what&#8217;s a cracked faceplate</p>

<p>worth?) I know I&#8217;m going to find it hard not to just get a new Sony one&#8230; brand loyalty that goes against</p>

<p>my technical opinions.</p>

<p>I have vowed on numerous occasions to refuse to give advice on these topics, but people keep</p>

<p>asking and I keep telling them what I think. I don&#8217;t actually have any doubts about my advice, I try very</p>

<p>hard to be objective and break down the options for them so that they can make the final choice, but you</p>

<p>never know whether or not it will be the best possible choice for that particular person and their</p>

<p>situation. When you are making the choice for yourself, you accept that risk that you are making the wrong decision&#8230; and you decide to live with that risk, but it is always hard for me to make a similar decision for some one else, some one who might end up frustrated with the result in a few years time. Sure, it is only a gadget, but try telling that to someone who spent $2,000 dollars on music for iTunes or Napster (or has even taken the time to rip a few hundred CDs to a certain format) and has now decided that they don&#8217;t want to use that technology anymore.</p>
