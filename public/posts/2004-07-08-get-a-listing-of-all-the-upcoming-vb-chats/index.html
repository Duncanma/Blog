For the most part, these chats focused on answering your questions about Visual Basic.</em>

    <em>Naturally, now that the Beta 1 for Visual Basic 2005 is available, I wanted to schedule some chats to answer your Beta questions. But after discussing this with Robert Green, we decided to change the format somewhat; instead of just answering questions, the chat hosts will also be looking for feedback about what you like (or don&#8217;t like) about the selected feature&#8230;.</em>
