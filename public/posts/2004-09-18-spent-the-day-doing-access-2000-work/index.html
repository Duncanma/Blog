    <p>As part of the United Way&#8217;s Day of Caring, I went into Seattle today and did some work for a non-profit counseling center&#8230; specifically creating an Access system for them&#8230;. a few tables, 3 forms, and a bunch of analysis queries and reports all around stats&#8230;</p>

<p>Great stuff&#8230;. helping out a non-profit, but it was my first time building anything in Access in ages&#8230;. I used to do it all the time as part of past jobs, etc&#8230;. but even doing VBA is enough of change for me that I felt really rusty. Overall though, I got the work done and that is the key to a database tool like Access. Personally, while I was longing for SQL Server and VB.NET, I saw a lot of features in Access (even Access 2000) that you just can&#8217;t find in VB.NET (or C#)&#8230;</p>

<p>What do you think? Are there development features of Access that would be good to have in your &#8216;professional&#8217; development tools? Use the <a href="http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2004/09/18/658.aspx#FeedBack">comments/feedback</a>{.broken_link} link to let me know your thoughts!</p>
