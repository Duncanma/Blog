    <p>I&#8217;m part of a dev team that builds blog/forum software and I&#8217;ve been thinking about mobile interfaces lately&#8230; so I&#8217;m trying to find a good example of site like ours that provides a good (enjoyable, useful and usable) mobile interface&#8230; one that will work across a variety of browses. It seems 37 Signals is thinking about the same thing these days and they&#8217;ve made a blog post looking for exactly the same thing I am, <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/745-link-it-up-mobile-web-app-interfaces">examples of good mobile interfaces</a>. I&#8217;m looking for sites that are some combination of text and video blogging and are usable via a relatively modern phone. I found a lot of the comments to that post to be completely unhelpful&#8230; because they were focused on sites that are specific to the iPhone! Building an interface for the iPhone is not a bad idea, but I certainly wouldn&#8217;t try to do that until after we had a good general purpose interface for a much wider variety of mobile devices. I did find a few interesting sites though, from the comments and from another site (Brian Cantoni&#8217;s list of good mobile sites at <a href="http://cantoni.mobi/" title="http://cantoni.mobi/">http://cantoni.mobi/</a>):</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://mobile.seriouseats.com/" title="http://mobile.seriouseats.com/">http://mobile.seriouseats.com/</a></p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/text_only.stm" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/text_only.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/text_only.stm</a></p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://bbcriver.com/" title="http://bbcriver.com/">http://bbcriver.com/</a>{.broken_link} (seems like it would benefit from some paging, but I could be wrong&#8230; is one big page better on a phone than paging?)</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://m.joystiq.com/" title="http://m.joystiq.com/">http://m.joystiq.com/</a></ul>
&nbsp;
<br /></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, all of these map well to the home page of our site(s) (like <a href="http://on10.net/">on10.net</a>{.broken_link} or <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com">Channel 9</a>), I wonder if there are any good examples for a web forum? I&#8217;m pretty sure that a lot of our users would like to be able to view <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Showforum.aspx?forumid=15">Channel 9&#8217;s Coffeehouse</a>{.broken_link} on their mobile device, and off hand I don&#8217;t know what the ideal experience for that would be.</p>

<p>On a related note, Brian Cantoni (the author of that <a href="http://cantoni.mobi/">list of good mobile sites</a>) has a great series of blog articles about <a href="http://www.cantoni.org/2007/12/19/palmossimulator">testing your web applications across all major smartphone platforms</a>.</p></li>
