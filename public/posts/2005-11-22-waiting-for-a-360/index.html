Stopped by Fred Meyer tonight to print out a digital photo, asked the guy if they were getting any 360 buzz&#8230; they have 12 premium systems to sell, opening at 7am, and already over a 100 calls asking when they opened and when the line was going to start&#8230; that is going to be a lot of disappointed folks&#8230;"/>
