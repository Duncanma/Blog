    <p>That may not seem like a big deal to most MIcrosoft developers, since most of them write code for that exact purpose, but I have spent most of my time in Redmond writing sample code and even with my switch to development I&#8217;m focused on writing internal systems that are not likely to ever be exposed outside of our own users. Recently, the Tablet PC folks released the &#8220;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/tabletpc/experiencepack/default.mspx">Experience Pack for Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005</a>{.broken_link}&#8220;, which includes the Media Transfer application/power toy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/tabletpc/experiencepack/mediatransfer.mspx">Getting started with Media Transfer</a>{.broken_link}<br />
<emphasis>Easily copy photos, music, and videos from your desktop PC to your Tablet PC, even over your wireless network.</emphasis></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, behind the scences, that application uses <a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/pull.aspx?pageToPull=http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun02282003.asp">my BITS code</a>{.broken_link} to handle its file transfers. This Visual Basic .NET library is really <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwxp/html/WinXP_BITS.asp?frame=true">a wrapper around the BITS APIs</a>, but it is a pretty major abstraction (adding OO concepts and .NET niceties like collections to what is really a flat Win32 style API) that makes it a lot easier to work with the BITS features.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve seen a demo of the application itself, and the rest of that experience pack, and it looks amazing&#8230; but I wouldn&#8217;t ask me for any more info about it, because I don&#8217;t have a Tablet PC, so I can&#8217;t even run it!</p>
