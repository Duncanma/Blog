    <p>I&#8217;ve recently accepted a job with the <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/about.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Channel 9 team</a> (working for <a href="http://www.jeffsandquist.com/" target="_blank">Jeff</a> and working with <a href="http://www.adamkinney.com" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Adam</a>, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/eporter/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Erik</a>, <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Robert</a>, and <a href="http://carmine.blogs.com/kernel/" target="_blank">Charles</a>), and &#8230; because I&#8217;m mostly a one-job kind of guy, that means I have to stop working at MSDN. So, come January 16th, I&#8217;ll be over in a new office at Channel 9, probably not coding anything yet as it always take a few days to get ramped up, connected to the right source trees, etc&#8230;</p>

<p>This is quite a big move for me, even though it is still within Microsoft. I joined the company back in 1999, working as a MCS consultant up in Winnipeg, MB, and then I moved down to Redmond in 2001 to join <a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/articles/default.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">the MSDN article writing team</a>. Since then I may have moved around a bit in terms of role (Writer, Content Strategist, Developer), but I stayed with the same group for the last four and a half years. As time goes by, it becomes harder and harder to make a change; you get very comfortable working with the same people on the same issues, in the same offices, even the same source trees and server names. I think that, as much as I have enjoyed the last year, even my move to the MSDN development team was a bit of cold-feet about leaving MSDN. I had decided that it was time to make a change and try out a different role within Microsoft, but it seemed so much safer, so much more familar to find another position that was still within MSDN.</p>

<p>Now it is a year later, and some might say I still am not making that big of a change&#8230; it is still Microsoft, it is still working on one of our web properties, it is still somewhat similar in its content/community focus (not that similar, but relatively so)&#8230; but in the ways that matter to me, it is a very big change. Channel 9 is a much smaller team, and their mix of content vs. community is tilted much farther towards the community side. Not that it necessarily means anything, but I certainly noticed that <strong>everyone</strong> on the Channel 9 team has a blog &#8230; which isn&#8217;t required for any team, but it does suggest certain attitudes and priorities&#8230;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure I can still write articles for MSDN (if I have time), although I might end up contributing some content to other sites as well. I still plan on talking about some of the work that has been done to build MSDN&#8217;s new web platform, including all the great work that will be done after I&#8217;ve left, but you can expect to start hearing more and more about the new work I&#8217;m doing at Channel 9 as well. I&#8217;ll do my best to make it all interesting to read ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>I suspect that some folks will connect this change with the <a href="http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2005/12/13/3387.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">recent departure of Brian Johnson</a>, and the not so recent departure of <a href="http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2005/11/11/3255.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Kent Sharkey</a>&#8230; and I would be lying if I said there was <strong>absolutely</strong> no connection&#8230; but I am not leaving MSDN because they did&#8230; although I was starting to worry about who I would be going for coffee with each day. For at least a year, it was a near unbroken ritual for the three of us to make our latte runs together in the morning each day, and for the past few months Brian and I have done our best to continue on without Kent, but soon it would have just been me and that would have been weird. Now I guess I need to figure out who on my new team shares my caffeine addiction and develop some new rituals.</p>
