<p><a href="http://gadgetmodels.i4u.com/gadget_photo_model_April_20060.html" target="_blank" class="broken_link"><br /> <img src="http://gadgetmodels.i4u.com/gallery/April_2006/xbox_360_model_1.jpg" height="168" width="120" align="left" /><br /> </a>I&#8217;ve remarked to a few people that writing a more &#8216;consumer&#8217; focused book has been quite different from my usual area of writing (covering programming topics mostly), but <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/brianjo/blog/cns!57C723EC58B8F3A3!964.entry?_c11_blogpart_blogpart=blogview&#038;_c=blogpart#permalink" target="_blank">this takes the cake</a>.</p>

<p>Gadget Models, a site that seems to combine the two popular topics of models and technology, has run <a href="http://gadgetmodels.i4u.com/gadget_photo_model_April_20060.html" target="_blank" class="broken_link">a feature that includes our book</a>. Sadly, we weren&#8217;t at all involved. Note to anyone who is worried about the content of the site itself, I didn&#8217;t look through it all but it doesn&#8217;t seem to cross into nudity or anything like that&#8230;</p>

<p>On another note, I just got back tonight from a week&#8217;s vacation&#8230; a vacation that included a lot of sleep and even some reading (of actual books), but no Xbox 360 and almost no email&#8230; so tonight I&#8217;m hoping to get back on with Oblivion!</p>
