<p><a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/blog/nike-actually-makes-me-consider-an-ipod/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">My previous post</a>&nbsp;about the Nike+ system left me searching for a similar solution for non-iPod users&#8230; without a lot of luck, but Mark let me know about <a href="http://www.sportsdo.net">http://www.sportsdo.net</a>, which is very cool. This site/software uses any GPS enabled Windows Mobile device to produce some useful info about your activity (running, skiing, whatever). I&#8217;m interested and I&#8217;ll probably enjoy using it, but it isn&#8217;t really going to compete with the Nike+ system for two reasons:&nbsp;The first reason&nbsp;is that GPS isn&#8217;t a great solution for this type of use, especially for someone (me) who does at least half their runs on a treadmill&#8230; (hmm&#8230; the software seems to think I haven&#8217;t moved&#8230;), and secondly there is the question of the device. I&#8217;m not planning to carry my Moto Q with me while I run, it is too big. Even the smallest Windows Mobile device (that I know of) isn&#8217;t really meant to be used while running, and I doubt many such devices come with an armband ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Still, it is neat&#8230; perhaps if I would be willing to wear a &#8216;fanny pack&#8217;, I wouldn&#8217;t mind stashing the Q in there.</p>
