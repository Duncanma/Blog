I put off reading the book at all for quite some time, figuring that once I started I would neglect other responsibilities (including some sleep) until it was done, and I also thought that it would be good to go back and re-read #10, so that the story flowed better for me."/>

<p>I put off reading the book at all for quite some time, figuring that once I started I would neglect other responsibilities (including some sleep) until it was done, and I also thought that it would be good to go back and re-read #10, so that the story flowed better for me. I didn&#8217;t end up re-reading the previous book, that would have taken way too long, but the reduction in sleep as I read the book was certainly the case.</p>
