    <p>I don&#8217;t know if it is just me, but there are some times when a new product comes out and they have me from the moment I see the ad; the price is right, the features are exactly what I am looking for, etc&#8230;</p>

<p>Well, that happened this weekend&#8230; I have been pondering on getting a progressive scan DVD player for some time, and I had been stuck on a few things;</p>

<ul>
<li>I have only two Component video inputs on my TV, plus a DVI&#8230; I&#8217;m thinking of upgrading my music player to use the component in, but that would mean removing my DVD player or my XBox&#8230; hmm&#8230; certainly not willing to do that if I get a progressive scan player&#8230; boy, sure would be nice to use that DVI input for something,

<ul>
<li>I&#8217;m thinking DVD recorders (which normally include progressive output) are dropping in price all the time,

<ul>
<li>and finally, I&#8217;m not convinced that the results will be that much better with a progressive scan dvd player&#8230; as I understand it, my TV is capable of some of the same conversion&#8230; but gee, if it was all digital to digital and if it could take advantage of my TVs ability to do 720p, instead of just 480p&#8230; now that would be something&#8230;</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, to get to the point&#8230; I saw this new <a href="http://www.samsungusa.com/cgi-bin/nabc/product/b2c_product_detail.jsp?eUser=&prod_id=DVD-HD931%2fXAA" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Samsung DVD player</a> in a flyer from Best Buy&#8230; $299, includes DVI out, uses a Farjouda chip (not sure on that spelling), and upconverts to 720p or 1080i &#8230; instead of 480p .. and it is all digital-to-digital instead of passing into an analog output phase&#8230; yep, I&#8217;m grabbing my wallet and heading to Best Buy right then&#8230; $299 is right at that point where I am willing to make a rather large impulse purchase once or twice a year&#8230;</p>

<p>Quick check online to see if it comes with a DVI cable&#8230; nope, hmm&#8230;. how much do they cost? $99.99?!?!? And then it was over, before it began&#8230; now we are talking about approx $400 and I&#8217;ve left my impulse buy zone &#8230; will need to put this off until next year perhaps&#8230; very disappointing ðŸ™‚</p>
