<p><a href="http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2006/10/10/Soon_3A00_-Dig-Dug.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Fairly mixed response over on MajorNelson.com to this game</a>, mostly either people who love it or people who are wishing we&#8217;d stop with the &#8216;retro&#8217; games already&#8230; I&#8217;m a bit on the fence here myself, I like these games (Dig Dug, Time Pilot, Pac Man&#8230;) <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/55732290@N00/221454813/"><img alt="" hspace="0" src="http://static.flickr.com/93/221454813_a5af3ae0b1_m.jpg" align="right" border="0" /></a>but I&#8217;m pretty disappointed that they&#8217;ve been left so &#8230; &#8216;pure&#8217; &#8230; I mean, I think it would be cool to have an &#8216;original&#8217; game mode that only uses a fraction of the pixels of my TV, but I would really like to see another mode (one that I think would be really popular) where the graphics really are on par with what we&#8217;d expect on a 360.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not suggesting changing the game, making Dig Dug into a FPS or anything, just redoing the graphics to take advantage of a 720p screen. Hell, even just scaling the game screen up to fill more of my screen would make me happy&#8230; even if it stayed blocky ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>
