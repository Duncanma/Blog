<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="teal">The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/columns/codefun.asp" class="broken_link">Coding4Fun</a> column has<br /> had some interesting side effects. I get to use the code I write, something that<br /> isn&#8217;t very common when you are paid to write samples.</font></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="teal">I wanted to pull down <a href="http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rl_cmp/sequel_trailers.html">the new<br /> Matrix Trailer</a>, but it is around 60mb and I often switch networks (<a href="http://dotnetweblogs.com/ksharkey/posts/5206.aspx" class="broken_link">VPN on/off to get my<br /> mail</a>, connect to the VSS on an internal server, etc.) so I opened the<br /> Background Copy program from my <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun02282003.asp" class="broken_link">second<br /> issue</a>&#8230; off it goes, incremental background download (can&#8217;t take credit for<br /> any of that, thank the team that built <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/bits/bits/using_bits.asp" class="broken_link">BITS</a>!)..<br /> my wife has had&nbsp;the email checker (actually an early build without an<br /> options dialog, I just put the values right into the .config file for her) from<br /> <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun03282003.asp" class="broken_link">the<br /> third issue </a>running <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> and <a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/musicxp" class="broken_link">my home music system </a>uses the<br /> code techniques from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun01242003.asp" class="broken_link">the<br /> first issue </a>as it scans our system for music updates every few<br /> hours.</font></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="teal">This is pretty cool so far, and right<br /> now I&#8217;m running some code,&nbsp;(that I hope will&nbsp;make it in as part<br /> of&nbsp;the next issue/installment), that is making my Messenger name into<br /> something ugly like &#8220;Duncan (Listening To: I Love Myself Today &#8212; Bif Naked<br /> [3:52])&#8221;</font></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="teal">The next thing is to make it work the<br /> other way around: instead of personally using code I wrote for publication, I<br /> want to&nbsp;publish <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/community/workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=cd71ce33-9238-4ba0-a1e6-294413f743b9" class="broken_link">code<br /> I wrote at home </a>for use by everyone else.</font></p>
