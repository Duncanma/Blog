    <p>We recently updated a few of our web sites with code that would provide a &#8216;nicer&#8217; experience for browsers that were not compatible with the ASP.NET ATLAS (AJAX) scripts we were using. For some reason though, a few users who were running a fully compatible browser (Firefox 2.0.0.*), were seeing the no-script experience. We were puzzled, but one of the users figured out that their ImageShack toolbar might be causing the problem. Sure enough, after I installed that same toolbar myself I was able to test and confirm that it truly is causing the confusion.</p>

<p>Using a little test page, <a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/services/browserinfo.aspx" title="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/services/browserinfo.aspx">http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/services/browserinfo.aspx</a>{.broken_link} (feel free to use it for your own testing), I received the following results for Firefox 2.0.0.11 on Vista <strong>before</strong> installing the ImageShack toolbar.</p>

<p>Request.Browser</p>

<ul>
<li>.Type: Firefox2.0.0.11</li>
<li>.Platform: WinNT</li>
<li>.Version: 2.0.0.11</li>
<li>.Browser: Firefox</li>
<li>.Crawler: False</li>
<li>.EcmaScriptVersion: 1.4</li>
<li>.IsMobileDevice: False</li>
<li>.MobileDeviceManufacturer: Unknown</li>
<li>.MobileDeviceModel: Unknown</li>
<li>.Beta: False</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After installing the toolbar, I get this:</p>

<p>Request.Browser</p>

<ul>
<li>.Type: Mozilla1.8.1.11</li>
<li>.Platform: WinNT</li>
<li>.Version: 1.8.1.11</li>
<li>.Browser: Mozilla</li>
<li>.Crawler: False</li>
<li>.EcmaScriptVersion: 1.4</li>
<li>.IsMobileDevice: False</li>
<li>.MobileDeviceManufacturer: Unknown</li>
<li>.MobileDeviceModel: Unknown</li>
<li>.Beta: False</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note the version change and the change in Request.Browser.Browser, certainly enough to throw off our atlas-compatibility check. I haven&#8217;t figured out the appropriate fix for this yet, but it is nice to at least have one possible explanation as to why valid browsers are sometimes seeing our &#8216;no script&#8217; experience.</p>
