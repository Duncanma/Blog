<p>For example, and this should be of interest to the readers of this post, you can query on all newsgroups with csharp in their name using <a href="http://netscan.research.microsoft.com/default.asp?timespan=m&compare=1&searchfor=csharp&searchdate=11%2F30%2F2003" target="_blank" class="broken_link">this link</a>, and then from that page you can dig down to find out about the hot topics, the most active authors and more&#8230;</p>

<p>Within just a few seconds of playing around on NETSCAN, I was able to find out that Jon Skeet and Mattias Sj&ouml;gren, both members of <a href="http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">the MVP program</a>, are the two most active authors on the main C# newsgroup&#8230; very cool stuff.</p>

<p>The NETSCAN team is very interested in what developers think of their system, so please let me know what you think!!</p>
