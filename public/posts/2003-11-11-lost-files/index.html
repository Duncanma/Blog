<p>I downloaded and installed the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/whidbey" target="_blank" class="broken_link">VB Language Enhancements for Whidbey</a> White Paper &amp; code from an MSI and cannot freakin&#8217; find it anywhere! ðŸ™‚ I had to stop looking after 20 minutes. So hopefully, I&#8217;ll update this post with the location after Duncan or someone can clue me in. I&#8217;m not mad. I think it&#8217;s kind of funny.</p>

<p>Ok, Ok&#8230; so I built that install file&#8230; so I guess I&#8217;m the one to blame. I haven&#8217;t gotten around to writing a custom action to launch the folder after install, but it is on my list of things-to-do &#8230; unless someone else writes it first! In general though, all of my installs put things under My Documents\MSDN so that you don&#8217;t require admin privileges to open up the code and modify it&#8230; I hope that works out for folks!</p>

<p>If you have any thoughts on improving the install process of any of the installs from MSDN, let me know and I&#8217;ll try to improve our process where ever possible.</p>
