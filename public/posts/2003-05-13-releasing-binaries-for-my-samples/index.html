<p>I never really considered that possibility, and in some cases I didn&#8217;t even write the code with that in mind, but now I&#8217;m wondering if I should at least provide a built install file in with the downloadable code sample for non-programmers&#8230; weird thought. Whatever I do, I can&#8217;t support people who use the sample without compiling it themselves&#8230; the code sample is merely a way to show some interesting concept(s), I try to make the applications interesting but they certainly aren&#8217;t the point.</p>
