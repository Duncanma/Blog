    <p>Currently I&#8217;m running .Text .94 + a bunch of private modifications and some version of CS:Forums + a bunch of private modifications&#8230; so <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rhoward/archive/2005/02/25/380444.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">now that CS 1.0&#8217;s source is out</a>, I want to incorporate my mods into the combined package and then migrate my data and get my site up and running on the new stuff. As cool as that is, and while I&#8217;m sure it has excellent tools/scripts for upgrading, I&#8217;m not looking forward to it. It was hard enough to get my site set up now, with blogs.duncanmackenzie.net running as its own app domain and then trying to make the Forums code work when the application started at the root not at /Forums. Anyway, suffice it to say I don&#8217;t expect to upgrade right away, but maybe I&#8217;ll have a copy of the site upgraded and sitting on my dev box within the next week&#8230;.</p>

<p>Anyone else gone through the upgrade/migration and have any thoughts or comments?</p>
