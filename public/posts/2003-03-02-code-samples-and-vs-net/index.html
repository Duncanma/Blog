<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="teal">the other day&#8230; since I am a writer for MSDN and<br /> other places,&nbsp;this a topic that I&#8217;ve thought about quite a bit&#8230; sadly,<br /> the only real solution seems to be&nbsp;posting code that works with both<br /> situations (VS.NET and non-VS.NET) because posting code that doesn&#8217;t work well<br /> in the Windows Forms designer is a bad-experience for people using VS.NET and<br /> designer-generated code produces a bad experience for those who are not using<br /> VS.NET.</font></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="teal">Web Matrix makes this even more<br /> interesting as now there are multiple IDEs from Microsoft that might require<br /> different code samples/downloads to illustrate the same topic&#8230; </font></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="teal">To me this is very similar to the idea<br /> of posting code in both C# and VB.NET for every article&#8230; it is a good idea,<br /> but I don&#8217;t always have the time to produce two versions, so I pick one. Same<br /> with the IDE vs. no-IDE, I pick one&#8230; and actually I don&#8217;t always pick the same<br /> one. It generally depends on what I am building and who it is for. VB.NET<br /> programmers, in general, use the IDE, especially for Windows Forms, so I will<br /> provide them with a project file and all that generated code.</font></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="teal">On the other hand, the code I wrote for<br /> the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnguinet/html/drguinetnhp.asp" class="broken_link">Dr.<br /> GUI .NET columns </a>(I&#8217;m not Dr. GUI, I just write code for him sometimes) was<br /> aimed at people trying to understand the framework, so it was written targetting<br /> someone with a text editor and csc/vbc. I wish there were more times when it was<br /> easy to do both, but that generally only happens when I do console or library<br /> apps; I wrote <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnbda/html/bdadotnetasync1.asp" class="broken_link">some<br /> MSMQ articles </a>for MSDN that had the vbc and csc command lines as a comment<br /> in the first line of each code file, but also included a project file&#8230; and I<br /> think that would have worked well for both &#8220;types&#8221; of people. I wrote lots of<br /> code in my <a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/books/Teach%20Yourself%20Visual%20Basic.NET%20in%2021%20Days.htm" class="broken_link">book</a><br /> that was aimed at the command line compiler, in an attempt to keep it simple and<br /> avoid confusing the beginning programmer with the IDE, but I think it was a<br /> mistake; command line compiling just isn&#8217;t a good experience for a new developer<br /> who isn&#8217;t used to it already.</font></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="teal">What do you think I should do about<br /> these issues (IDE and language, go ahead and fire away) for my<br /> writing?&nbsp;And, while we are on a IDE-related topic, what about the visual<br /> tools for building database code? I never use them, I never drag and drop a<br /> connection, a data-adapter, or anything like it onto my Forms. So I never use<br /> them in my articles. They seem cool enough though, and lots of people like<br /> them&#8230; I&#8217;ve just had something against wizard-generated code ever since my Fox<br /> Pro 2.6 days, and I think my internal &#8220;control-freak&#8221; is appeased by writing all<br /> my data access code by hand&#8230; am I crazy? Should I use the tools, do you use<br /> them?</font></p>
