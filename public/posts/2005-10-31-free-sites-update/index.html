    <p>I mentioned earlier how the <a href="http://xbox360s.freepay.com/?r=23139488" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Free Xbox 360 site</a> was quite busy, and it is&#8230; tons of clicks, 12 sign-ups, and even one person has &#8216;gone green&#8217; which is to say they completed their offer. Once 8 people (who click through your referral link) have signed-up and completed an offer, then you are all done, but the sign-up to completion ratio is not great, probably 1 in every 5, so a lot of folks sign-up and then find that they either are not interested in the available offers or they don&#8217;t think it is likely that they&#8217;ll get an additional 8 people to sign-up through them. One of the more difficult aspects of these sites is that they don&#8217;t tell you how many referrals are needed until <strong>after</strong> you sign up, so if you were thinking 4 referrals and it ends up being 10, that is a pretty good reason to bail on the entire system. I&#8217;m currently sitting 3 away on the <a href="http://www.pvps4free.com/default.aspx?r=160508" target="_blank">PVP</a> site, 4 on the <a href="http://www.psps4free.com/default.aspx?r=315551" target="_blank" class="broken_link">PSP</a> and 4 on the <a href="http://www.mp3players4free.com/default.aspx?r=206786" target="_blank" class="broken_link">MP3 Players site</a>&#8230; and, in all honestly, I don&#8217;t really expect any of them to go completely through. Now that I&#8217;m not going through a service like RefStop, where you trade referalls on somone else&#8217;s account for them signing up through you and doing a referall on your account, 3 or 4 sign-ups is a pretty unlikely target.</p>
