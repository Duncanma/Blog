<p><font face="Verdana" color="teal">, part of the ongoing Coding 4 Fun experience!</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="teal">Speaking of Coding 4 Fun, or the lack thereof&#8230; I&#8217;m sitting in a wireless lounge at TechEd, where I have spent most of my trip to Dallas&#8230; doing remote troubleshooting and coding on a system back in Redmond. Not a unique experience, I&#8217;m sure many of the people reading this entry have ended up working from a remote location when they expected to attend sessions or other activities&#8230; but still not the best way to spend one&#8217;s time.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="teal">On the upside, wireless connectivity just rocks at this event, I&#8217;m connected almost all of the time and my only concern has been power&#8230; but every table in the wireless lounge happens to have a power bar, so it has become my hangout of choice. I did manage to spend the morning at the MSDN booth, which was pretty cool&#8230;. and of course,<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/duncanma/posts/8124.aspx" class="broken_link"> last night&#8217;s dinner </a>with some local (and <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/sibrahim/" class="broken_link">not so local</a>) bloggers was quite enjoyable (until Elvis started playing at least).</font></p>
