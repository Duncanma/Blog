    <p>It is like bootleg concert recordings but the quality is better and I had to pay for it ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>Tonight my wife and I went out to <a href="http://www.instantliveconcerts.com/bands_main.php3?id=192">a Jewel Concert</a>{.broken_link}, which was great&#8230; although our position on the grass gave us a better view of one of the main support poles on the stage than of Jewel herself&#8230; and at the end of the show, we picked up our &#8220;Instant Live&#8221; CD of the concert (yes, the concert that had just ended). I wasn&#8217;t keeping exact track, but it seems like it was approximately 15 minutes from the end of the show until the first boxes of CDs, already in <em>&#8216;jewel&#8217;</em> cases, came out for distribution.</p>

<p>Now, if you really wanted to, you could just leave and then go to their website and order a recording (for $5 more, but only if you already had paid for a CD at the show), but I really wanted to have the actual disc within minutes of watching the show, so I made Laura (my wife) wait ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>As I mentioned at the beginning of the post, the quality of the music was good&#8230; I&#8217;d even say excellent&#8230; so if you like live CDs (and don&#8217;t mind the ambient crowd noise) then you&#8217;ll really want to check this out if you see it at a concert.</p>
