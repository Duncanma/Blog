        There is even an accompanying <a href="http://addressof.com/blog/articles/checkerssolitaire.aspx" target="_blank">article</a>. Oh, and a challenge:
      </p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          The first person that can send me a history file that shows the gameplay getting to 1 piece left (with the default 8x8x2 game), I&#8217;ll happily annouce it to the world (at least the readers of this site). Do you have what it takes? If you think you do; let the challenge begin. Even if you can get it down to less than 4, I&#8217;ll be happy to mention your name as well.
        </p>

        Good luck!
