<p>I love this&#8230; and the funny thing was, I had just finished searching MSN for &#8220;Phil Ringnalda&#8221; (because I had forgotten his URL, well actually because I kept spelling his name wrong when I typed it as a URL) without much success.</p>

<p>&#8230; I don&rsquo;t have any way of knowing whether Google first decided I was garbage, and then decided that made me a duplicate of other people aggregating me, or decided I was garbage because I was a duplicate of people duplicating me, but I know it isn&rsquo;t helping: the only time you should let search engines index the output of an aggregator is when that&rsquo;s the only place the feeds appear as HTML. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s duplicate content, and that&rsquo;s going to wind up hurting someone, whether it&rsquo;s you or the source. &#8230;</p>

<p>just a small quote there, you definitely need to <a href="http://weblog.philringnalda.com/2006/01/08/searching-where-im-not-hated" title="Phil Ringnalda: Searching Where I'm Not Hated" target="_blank">read the whole thing&#8230;</a></p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time I&#8217;ve seen someone questioning the implicit relationship between crawlers and content producers (we let you use our bandwidth, in return people can find our content), see <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/search_engines.html" target="_blank">Jakob Nielsen&#8217;s search engine post</a>, but it does appear to be happening more and more these days.</p>
