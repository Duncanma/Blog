    <p>When I started on the C9 dev team, one of the first things I did was to <strong>remove</strong> the ability for users to post embed, object and script tags. We had a couple of people abusing this feature and I wanted to lock it right down. The downside to this move was that it prevented some forms of user interaction/posts that we didn&#8217;t really mind and in some cases would even like to encourage.</p>

<p>As a small step towards a more community-driven future, <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=338082">I added support to C9 today to allow you to embed Soapbox videos in any forum post</a>{.broken_link}. Simple use the following markup in your post:</p>

<p>[soapbox video=&#8221;(soapbox video id)&#8221;]</p>

<p><a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/images/8c137ad7-737a-4ae6-9a2b-08156604e749.png" atomicselection="true" rel="lightbox[521]" title="image"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="130" alt="image" src="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/images/8338d4f6-9266-4adf-84cf-c2f7b46e354b.png" width="240" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>and it will turn it into a full blown embed tag with a link to the source material underneath. The Soapbox video id is simply the GUID that appears on the permalink url (<a href="http://soapbox.msn.com/video.aspx?vid=5699dafe-d864-4d1f-976c-d5f4d9ed78db">http://soapbox.msn.com/video.aspx?vid=5699dafe-d864-4d1f-976c-d5f4d9ed78db</a>{.broken_link} for example) for a video and also shows up in its embed code if you take a look at that as well.</p>
