    <p>As I&#8217;ve mentioned before, I have a <a href="http://www.gamefly.com/" target="_blank">Gamefly</a> subscription and I get new games every few weeks&#8230; a great way to play a lot of games without the risk of paying $60 for a stinker (OverG Fighters for example&#8230; oh so happy I rented that instead of buying). Anyway, my most recent game is Chromehounds and I&#8217;m really enjoying it.&nbsp;It plays way more &#8216;real&#8217;&nbsp;than a game like MechAssault, but isn&#8217;t attempting to be a simulator and force you to control all the details a real mech would need dealt with. I honestly haven&#8217;t tried the online side of it yet, and I hear that is the best part&#8230; I&#8217;ve just played through all of the single player mission with the exception of the final mission. I have tried that one with four different mech configurations and with a couple different strategies, but I haven&#8217;t made it through yet ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>Do you play Chromehounds? Online? Did you do the single player missions? Any hints for me about the final one!?!</p>
