<p><a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/blog/connect-your-xbox-360-gamertag-to-twitter/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">My twitter app</a> uses a web service hosted on my site to get all the necessary Xbox Live info&#8230;. way more than the twitter app actually uses. This is a SOAP API, located here:</p>

<p><a href="http://duncanmackenzie.net/services/XboxInfo.asmx">http://duncanmackenzie.net/services/XboxInfo.asmx</a>{.broken_link}</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I know that some people prefer a more RESTful API though, so I also have another &#8216;page&#8217; that you can call with a straight GET request and just pass the gamertag in as a query string parameter:</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
