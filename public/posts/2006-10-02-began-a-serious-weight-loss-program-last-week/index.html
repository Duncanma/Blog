    <p>I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/blog/Feeling-like-it-is-time-to-get-rid-of-the-flab/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">talked about losing weight before</a>, and I managed to lose a fair bit via the South Beach diet about a year and a half ago, but my weight recently started creeping up again and I decided to do something &#8216;big&#8217; to get on the right track (which is something I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/blog/Back-in-Redmond/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">considered before</a>). So, on Tuesday of last week I had my official first appointment with a dietitian as part of the <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> program at the Pro Club, which included a weigh-in ðŸ™‚ .</p>

<p>As of that day (<sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>26</sub>) I weighed in at 185lbs, and I entered into a program with a goal weight of around 160. For 15 weeks, plus another 12 weeks of &#8216;maintenance&#8217;, I&#8217;m being led through a pretty structured exercise and eating plan to permanently modify my behaviour and therefore my weight. Since that Tuesday I&#8217;ve been limited to 5 meal replacement shakes a day along with&nbsp;two 6oz servings of lean protein (chicken for me, but there is a wide variety of choices that fall under the lean category). At the same time I&#8217;ve been working out with a personal trainer three times a week, and twice more on my own.</p>

<p>Overall, my calories in have been reduced to around 1400-1500 per day, while my output has been greatly increased due to the exercise sessions (I exercised 4 or 5 times a week on my own, but not at the same level of intesity). Less in, more out&#8230; should work out well.</p>

<p>Fun times&#8230; it is hard to explain how much you start looking forward to vegetables (I think I get veggies in week 2!).</p>
