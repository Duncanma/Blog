<p>but, it sure looks cool, and that has added it to an overly long list of &#8216;things I would buy if I had the $$ to order them and the time to use them&#8217;.</p>

<p>It seems like a slightly more efficient idea to pay the $120 for <a href="http://www.smarthome.com/77706.html">a VGA-Component adapter</a> for my music system (so that it displays at 720 progressive, instead of 480 interlaced) and then build photo-viewing/slideshow support into it, but gadget-love isn&#8217;t about efficiency.</p>

<p>We (the content strategist team at MSDN) are heading down to Fry&#8217;s en masse on Tuesday, which should be a wonderful display of technology lust and perhaps even acquisition (although not by me, I&#8217;ve sated my gadget lust for a few months with that <a href="http://www.samsungusa.com/cgi-bin/nabc/product/b2c_product_detail.jsp?eUser=&amp;prod_id=DVD-HD931%2fXAA">DVI-equipped DVD player</a>{.broken_link})&#8230; yup, should be a fun time for all.</p>
