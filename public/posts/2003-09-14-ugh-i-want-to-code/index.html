    <p>I have a bunch of writing to do, but what I really want to do is code!</p>

<p>It turns out I have a bunch of coding to do as well&#8230; but the writing is <em>more overdue</em> than the coding (at the moment)!</p>

<p>Of course, I could just say to hell with them both and go play some <a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/products/swkotor">SW:KOTOR</a>, but I finished it a couple of nights ago and I&#8217;m not quite ready to start again&#8230; although the dark path should provide some interesting replay value.</p>

<p>I recently finished the first chapter of a new book quite a bit ahead of schedule. The book isn&#8217;t due out for quite awhile, but I was offered a place on the PDC version of the Whidbey DVD(s) <em>if I could get it in by last week</em>, and that was a chance I didn&#8217;t want to miss. Not going to the PDC? Well, don&#8217;t worry&#8230; I&#8217;m sure it will be posted somewhere pretty quick after the event&#8230; and it might even end up on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic">MSDN</a> around the same time&#8230;. hmm&#8230; I think I&#8217;m stalling, I&#8217;d better get back to work.</p>
