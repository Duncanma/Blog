<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="teal">Every time I go to<br /> a computer/electronics store I consider buying some <a href="http://www.maxell-data.com/cgi-bin/products.cgi?parent=48" class="broken_link">mini-CD-Rs</a>,<br /> but I have absolutely no reason to get them. But, I still look at them every<br /> time. I just want to burn something on them. Something that would fit into<br /> 210mb, something &#8220;cool&#8221; to send to a friend.. I&#8217;ll admit it, I just want to buy<br /> them because they look cute.</font></p>
