    <p>I used to get knee pain all the time, just walking down stairs would cause quite an ache, but after I dropped some weight that went away&#8230; now it seems that pounding my legs onto the pavement over and over again is firing it back up again, and it is getting bad enough that I&#8217;m feeling reluctant to run as often as I have been. Seeing me limp my way down the stairs into the changing room, someone that I was running with mentioned glucosamine, saying that it really helps repair the damaged &#8216;stuff&#8217; that is leading to the discomfort when I run down large hills. Well, I have no idea if it works or not, but a bit of searching turned up <a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/article/0,5033,s6-197-0-0-8138,00.html" target="_blank" class="broken_link">a fairly detailed article about these supplements</a> that makes them seem like a pretty good idea. I haven&#8217;t picked any up yet, but if I do I&#8217;ll let you know how it works out&#8230;</p>
