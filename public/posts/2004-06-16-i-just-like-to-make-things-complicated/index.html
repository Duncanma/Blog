    <p>When I started out to build a voting control, I drew up a set of requirements that led to a 5+ table system&#8230; some form of UI for creating/editing polls&#8230; plus the control itself. Then, when I had SQL running behind my web site, I wanted something up fast&#8230;. so I just grabbed a simple voting control from <a href="http://www.asp.net/" target="_blank">www.asp.net</a> (by Rob Howard). The simplicity of this control (and its database structure) is a big plus, especially for me &#8230; it is a great place to start to play around with ASP.NET.</p>

<p>It is nice enough, but it doesn&#8217;t do what I need, so it is time to go back to my original design and build my own code instead of just messing around with Rob&#8217;s.</p>

<p>My set of requirements, documented in the tried and true UBL (universal bulleted list) format&#8230; which isn&#8217;t approved by Rational, or even by me, for use on <strong>real</strong> projects but works fairly well when I am the designer/user/developer/tester &#8230;</p>

<p>I need a polling system that allows me to</p>

<ul>
<li>Display different polls on different areas of my site,

<ul>
<li>Specify dates for a poll to appear in different locations (without touching any of my actual site pages)

<ul>
<li>Allow the user to view results without voting, and then to be able to go back and vote if they wish to

<ul>
<li>Allow reporting of poll results, with full details (text displayed, etc..), even after the poll has ceased to be displayed

<ul>
<li>Track votes by date, so that votes can be summed across all time or for a specific date range

<ul>
<li>Track the site location from which the vote was submitted, so that response rate and actual results can be compared by location</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>I think that is about it for requirements&#8230; noting that I didn&#8217;t specify anything about how polls are created, controlled, edited, scheduled&#8230; I am a strong believer in incremental development so I can build the first poll or two manually while I finish that side of the system&#8230; and now I&#8217;m back at my 5 or so tables ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>There are still changes to make to this design, I want to be able to control the order of Options in the poll, for example&#8230; but I think I have enough to start building a proof-of-concept control&#8230;</p>
