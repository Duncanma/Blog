    <p>I&#8217;ve recently taken a little break from playing Oblivion, which had been the only disc in my 360 for the past couple of months, and I decided to try a range of games. While working on our book, <a href="http://www.xbox4dummies.com" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Xbox 360 for Dummies</a>, I added every single 360 game to my Q on <a href="http://www.gamefly.com" target="_blank">Gamefly.com</a>, so I end up getting a random selection whenever I send back the previous game.</p>

<p>This month, I returned Full Auto (interesting idea, combining guns and driving, but after playing PGR 3, Ridge Racer 6, and Need For Speed: Most Wanted&#8230; it just didn&#8217;t seem like my kind of driving game) and ended up with <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/r/rumblerosesxxxbox360/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Rumble Roses XX</a>. Whatever else I may say about that game, it certainly has expanded the range of games that I have tried. I&#8217;ve only played it for about an hour, but it left me with some mixed feelings so far. On one hand, it appears to be a pretty good wrestling game and I am completely in favour of sexy, scantitly glad women wrestingly on high-definition television. The problem for me is that the game seems to take it a bit too far. The idea of a good fighting game where the characters happen to be very attractive women is a good one&#8230; but even the quick match I played involved a little fashion show to start, taking way too long for each character to do a &#8216;runway walk&#8217; back and forth before getting into the ring. Outside of the fighting, the addition of a photo-shoot mode really showed how far from my idea of a &#8216;game&#8217; this title goes. I have no doubt that there is an audience for this game, but I prefer to keep my hand on the controller while playing. DOA4 hits a better balance in this sub-genre of games (the ones with hot chicks in revealing clothing that is), focusing way more on the fighting and letting the fact that the fighters are sexy women be a nice side benefit. DOA4 does have additional costumes, but the lack of a photo shoot mode and a much deeper game makes it more my style. I haven&#8217;t played the DOA volleyball game, but I gather it is more aimed at the Rumble Roses XX crowd.</p>

<p>My other full game experience this month has been with <a href="http://www.blazing-angels.com" target="_blank">Blazing Angels</a>, a game that I&#8217;ve been excited about from the moment I read the first description of it online. I love WWII planes, specifically the Spitfire, and I&#8217;ve been reading books about them ever since I was old enough to pick them out myself. I&#8217;ve played Combat Flight Simulator and other flying games (not that this is a simulator, it is more of a Crimson Skies type of game) that covered some of these planes, but I have never found one that looked or played this good. Flying a Spitfire IX over London, chasing down wave after wave of ME109s and Stukkas never really gets old for me. The Arcade mode makes for a lot of replayability after the campaign is done, and mutliplayer is always a good feature&#8230;. I&#8217;ve been playing Split Screen with my son, although he is enjoying flying his ME262 into the eiffel tower so much that he usuallly crashes before I can even come close to shooting him down.</p>

<p>I played a few other games here and there, but none of them for very long&#8230; certainly not long enough to form much of an opinion. I tried the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/l/laracrofttombraiderlegendxbox360/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Tomb Raider</a> demo though and I was quite impressed. If Ms. Croft was formed a bit more like Joanna Dark I would have been able to take it a bit more seriously, but all in all it reminded me a lot of the Prince of Persia games&#8230; but with the graphics bumped up a bit by the 360.</p>

<p>Next up, I&#8217;ll probably try out the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/r/rockstargamespresentstabletennisxbox360/default.htm" target="_blank" class="broken_link">table tennis game</a>, <a href="http://www.majornelson.com" target="_blank">Major Nelson</a> was pushing it pretty hard the last time we chatted (and that is always a good indicator for me), and I&#8217;m really looking forward to <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/l/lotrbattleformiddleearth2xbox360/default.htm" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Battle for Middle Earth II</a> to hit the 360.</p>
