<p><strong><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu/archive/2004/03/16/90939.aspx">Who does Microsoft talk to when they have questions?</a></strong></p>

<p><em>&#8230; The feedback we got around E&amp;C has been fairly polarized. There is one group who feels the way Rich does, and really wants E&amp;C. There is another group that actively doesn&#8217;t want E&amp;C, as they feel that it encourages the wrong kind of programming. And then there&#8217;s a group in the middle who typically see the value of E&amp;C but don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s critical. &#8230;</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu/archive/2004/03/16/90724.aspx">Zero or one based collection?</a></strong></p>

<p><em>To cover this subject, I&#8217;m going to have to set the way-back-machine for the 1980s or earlier, back when real men wrote in assembly and our bytes only had 7 bits. (aside &#8211; How many of you &#8211; and be honest here &#8211; have ever heard of machines where the word size wasn&#8217;t a multiple of 8? They really did exist).</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu/archive/2004/03/16/90712.aspx">What&#8217;s Wrong With This Code?</a></strong></p>

<p><em>Rather [than] bore my audience by presenting my views on implementing IDisposable, I&#8217;m going to take the “What&#8217;s wrong with this code?” approach. My goal is to present code examples that show code that&#8217;s doing something wrong &#8211; be it something prohibited by the language, something that&#8217;s ill-advised, or something with bad performance &#8211; and then let the attendees try to figure out what&#8217;s wrong with the code.</em></p>
