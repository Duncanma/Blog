    <p>I recently acquired a digital camera so I started thinking about a photo blog&#8230; something my family out in Winnipeg could subscribe to. A colleague, who has a camera phone, suggested textamerica, which seemed quite happy to accept my registration but I didn&#8217;t go through with the sign up because it seemed that they only intended camera <strong>phone</strong> users on their site, and I didn&#8217;t want to mess with their system&#8230;</p>

<p>Can anyone recommend a good place to post digital photos that makes it easy for family to view <a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/pics/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">the latest pic(s)</a> without too much hassle? I&#8217;m not looking for long-term or hi-quality storage here, I can handle that on my own site, but I was hoping for something simple where I could hold a rotating set of 10-20 pics&#8230;</p>

<p>Of course, I could just build up some pages on my own web site for this purpose, but I like the simplicity of photo blogs, even being able to email the pics up to the site is a great simplification over posting them to my own site.</p>
