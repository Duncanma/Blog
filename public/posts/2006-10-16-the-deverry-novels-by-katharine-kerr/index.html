This is an excellent series, but one that I found quite by accident.</p>

<p>Back when I was a fairly young kid, maybe 12 or 13, a friend of my mother was visting our house and upon realizing that I read the same type of books as him, offered to trade his set of books by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Eddings" target="_blank">David Eddings</a> for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deryni_novels" target="_blank">my &#8216;Deryni&#8217; series by Katherine Kurtz</a>. Now I read my books over and over again, so I didn&#8217;t understand what he meant&#8230; it seems perfectly logical to most folks that since we had both read our books once, this was a permanent trade, but I was quite surprised when I eventually figured that out. Of course, I could have just asked for my books back, but that didn&#8217;t seem appropriate and I certainly had enjoyed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Belgariad" target="_blank">Belgariad</a> (although the second set of books by Mr. Eddings seemed way too much of a retelling of the first&#8230; right down to the same characters&#8230; sure they were the descendants of the first set, but really&#8230; would they all end up with roughly the same personalites?). Anyway, I&#8217;ve always wanted to pick up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345326784?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=duncanmackenz-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0345326784">the Deryni series</a> <img style="border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none; margin: 0px; border-left: medium none; border-bottom: medium none" height="1" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=duncanmackenz-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0345326784" width="1" border="0" />again so I tend to look for them in bargain bins at bookstores and the like. Well, when I thought I had discovered a whole new series by the same person I immediately bought the first four books in the Deverry series. Of course, it was not the same person at all, Kerr instead of Kurtz, but I didn&#8217;t figure that out right away. So, I ended up reading a great series of books completely by accident.</p>

<p>How do you decide what to read? As a kid, I used to pick up the first book in a ton of new series and decided which ones&nbsp;I liked from there, but now (with the notable exception of Robert Jordan&#8217;s series) I haven&#8217;t picked up a book by a new-to-me author in ages. I know I could just go and grab some recent books from the library, but are there any good/great blogs/sites focused on the fantasy genre?</p>
