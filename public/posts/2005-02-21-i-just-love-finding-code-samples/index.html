<p><a href="http://www.brethorsting.com/mt3/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Aaron Brethorst</a> has a little page of his code samples up at <a href="http://www.brethorsting.com/code/" target="_blank" class="broken_link"><a href="http://www.brethorsting.com/code/">http://www.brethorsting.com/code/</a></a> which include a few interesting items including <strong>a software version of the Enigma machine in C#</strong>. Cool stuff. Aaron is also the author of <a href="http://www.sixdollarchimp.com/" target="_blank">iRooster, an alarm clock application (that uses playlists from iTunes)</a> which also looks neat, but runs on the Mac so it isn&#8217;t something that I have any real use for&#8230; :).</p>
