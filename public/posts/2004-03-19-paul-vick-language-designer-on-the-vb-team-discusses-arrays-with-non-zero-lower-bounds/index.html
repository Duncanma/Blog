<p><em>&#8230; To finesse this issue, the CLR designers came up with a compromise: there would be two kinds of arrays in the CLR. One kind, which I&#8217;ll call &#8220;arrays,&#8221; were just like normal VB arrays &#8211; they could have non-zero lower bounds. The other kind, which I&#8217;ll call &#8220;vectors,&#8221; were a restricted type of array: they could only be 1-dimensional, and their lower bound was fixed to be zero. This compromise allowed VB to have its arrays, and also allowed the C-derived languages to optimize the most common array case. Everyone was happy, right? &#8230;</em></p>
