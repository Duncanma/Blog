<p>I wish they had a single PC though, not light/dark versions, I love the images they&#8217;ve used for both&#8230; it would be cool to have each &#8216;side&#8217; represented on the opposite sides of the PC. I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll never split the case out on its own, as the whole point of this PC is to get you to pick up their highest-end PC just because you can&#8217;t resist the themed version. In fact, if you were a true fan you&#8217;d probably need to pick up both ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>No price yet on these boxes, but I&#8217;m sure the old adage of &#8220;if you have to ask&#8230;&#8221; probably applies in this situation.</p>

<p><em><strong>Update</strong>: the price is available now, and it actually seems much more reasonable than I had thought&#8230; starts at 1500 with specs that few folks would be really happy with and although it ranges up to $5000 (approx) with all the options, I spec&#8217;d one at 2235 that seemed pretty reasonable (put the ram up to 2GB, jumped the processor up a bit from the base, upped the hardrive from 80GB to 250GB&#8230; added the &#8216;alien ice&#8217; cooling system). Still no plans to buy one, but it doesn&#8217;t seem quite as far-fetched as I had originally thought.</em></p>
