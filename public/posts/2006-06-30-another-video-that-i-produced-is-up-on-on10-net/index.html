    <p>Sometimes I don&#8217;t like being just the guy behind the scenes ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>It isn&#8217;t anyone&#8217;s fault, everyone on our team is aware of the work I do, but sometimes I wish it was more visible to the public. I guess it is because I&#8217;m used to writing articles, that have my name so prominently attached, or blog posts that are so clearly mine&#8230; but when I work on videos for 10, I can be the guy who set up the interview, contacted all the right folks to make it happen and even (in this case) went over and held the camera&#8230; but yet, my name doesn&#8217;t end up anywhere in the video or the post. I&#8217;m not suggesting it should have (or that anyone is choosing to omit my name), by the way, I have the ability to edit the post at anytime so if I wanted it there&#8230; I&#8217;d just put it there&#8230; but it still seems like I&#8217;m missing out on some sort of credit. It would be cool to be able to point at a page that listed all the videos that I was the driving force behind&#8230; even if I then someone else was actually onscreen &#8230; collaborative effort and all that&#8230;</p>

<p>I guess that is just life in video land ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>Oh yeah, the video&#8230; we just put a <a href="http://on10.net/Blogs/TheShow/3722/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">video interview with a series of Xbox community folks</a>. This all took place on the same day as the interview with <a href="http://on10.net/Blogs/TheShow/3663/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Louis Castle from EA</a>&#8230; I heard (through Mike at <a href="http://www.xbox365.com" target="_blank">Xbox365.com</a>) that EA was going to have these guys and gals in town to look at the new Battle for Middle Earth II and I bugged the Xbox guys (well, Tony Hynes to be specific&#8230; the Xbox guy behind the event) to get us permission to crash the party with a camera. Of course, <a href="http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2006/06/30/See-some-of-the-Xbox-Community.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Major Nelson</a> had already arranged to be there along with his camera guy, so it was quite a crowd. Snagging each of the community folks one at a time (or two at a time in one case) and interviewing them on their own was nice though, good to get in touch with some of the people behind these great podcasts and sites.</p>
