    <p>A few people have emailed me or posted comments wondering how I grab the Xbox Info for <a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/blog/connect-your-xbox-360-gamertag-to-twitter/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">the Twitter app</a> and for <a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/blog/put-up-a-rest-api-for-xbox-gamertag-data/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">my services</a>.</p>

<p>It is not from scraping and it is not from any publicly available source. I joined the Xbox Community Developer Program (XCDP), which is an official program designed to support folks who are building <a href="http://www.xboxusersgroup.com/index.php" target="_blank" class="broken_link">community sites</a> (forums, reviews, blogs, etc&#8230;) around Xbox related topics.</p>

<p>Many folks who want Xbox info, are not working on <a href="http://www.mygamercard.net/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">a large site</a> like the people in the XCDP, which is exactly why I created my service. This way, people who are building a small tool or script, most likely to be used by a small number of folks, can have access to some well formed and easy to use data.</p>

<p>What if you would qualify for the XCDP? Well, at the moment I don&#8217;t have any direct link for you, but I&#8217;ll ask around to see if I can find a link or a contact for anyone may qualify and would like to sign up&#8230;.</p>
