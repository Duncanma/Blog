<p><font face="Verdana" color="#008080">Sara Williams, <strike>overlord</strike>&nbsp;manager of MSDN, has started <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/saraw" class="broken_link">her own blog</a>. I&#8217;m sure this will be a great place for discussion around MSDN futures and features. I know that many people who read my blog use MSDN every day,&nbsp;so I expect to see lots of comments!</font></p>
