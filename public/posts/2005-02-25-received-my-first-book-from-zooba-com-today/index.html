Basically, if you are someone who likes to read then you probably won&#8217;t mind the &#8216;requirement&#8217; to complete this offer. You sign up for a membership with Zooba, which costs around $10 a month and for that fee you get one hardcover book each month with no shipping costs. I&#8217;m not positive, but it seems to me that $10 is a good price for a hardcover book, and not even all that bad if you are used to paperbacks. I filled my queue on their site with 5 books that I liked, but my understanding is that you can cancel after only two book purchases, so the only real question is whether or not there are at least 2 books available through their site that you want to get anyway&#8230;</p>

<p>The book I received, by the way, was <strong>The Last Light of the Sun</strong> by one of my favorite authors: <a href="http://www.brightweavings.com/" target="_blank">Guy Gavriel Kay</a>. If you haven&#8217;t read any of his other books, I would definitely recommend <strong>Tigana</strong>, <strong>The Fionavar Tapestry</strong> (3 books) and all the rest of his writings ðŸ™‚</p>
