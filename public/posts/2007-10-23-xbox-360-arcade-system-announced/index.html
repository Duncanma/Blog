This one is similar to the original core system, but with HDMI output, a 256mb memory card (so you can play and save your games right out of the box), a wireless controller,&nbsp;and five full arcade games. Perfect if you are more of a casual gamer or if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you have an existing 360 with a hard drive and would like one with a HDMI output</li>
<li>you need a DVD player&nbsp;and/or a&nbsp;Media Center Extender (play all your Zune and Windows Media Center or Windows Media Player content in the living room!</li>
</ul>

<p>For that price, you can pick up this system instead of a DVD player with HDMI out and you get the network connectivity and media streaming features along with an amazing system for playing a ton of great games. Sure the name says Arcade, but you can fire up Halo 3, Gears of War or Lego Star Wars II&#8230;</p>

<p>Crazy stuff, and perfect for you family focused Xbox gamers&#8230; and perhaps soon to be a second 360 for my house, since I now have a TV with HDMI in and nothing to hook into it&#8230; and it would be great to have the ability to play my music, TV and movies on our second TV as well&#8230;</p>
