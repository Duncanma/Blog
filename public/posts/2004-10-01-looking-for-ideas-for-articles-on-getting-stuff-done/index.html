<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/rgreen_msft" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Robert Green</a> and I are planning a series of articles focused around Visual Basic 2005 Express Edition&#8230; quick articles, not a lot of text, but with enough code to do something cool and useful&#8230; but we need ideas, and we are looking for submissions of content. If you have some ideas, comment away&#8230; and if you&#8217;d be interested in submitting something, just let me know!</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
