<p>lest you think he is just another Nintendo basher, he goes on to make some really great points about how Nintendo makes good games for both adults and kids (much better games for kids than the Xbox has, if I wasn&#8217;t opposed to yet another console in the house, I would have bought a gamecube for my son ages ago)&#8230; and that people shouldn&#8217;t be reacting so strongly to the name</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;what person can look at a console, look at the games, say &#8220;yes, I want to play those&#8221; but then doesn&#8217;t because they don&#8217;t like the name? Do these people, upon hearing that their friends&#8217; or relatives&#8217; new baby, who had, in the womb, originally been named Mark, is now named Christopher, swear off all contact with the new child? Is that child now dead to them as all support for the spawn evaporates?&#8221;</p>
