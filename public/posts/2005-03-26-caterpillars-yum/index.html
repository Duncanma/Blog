<p><img align="right" src="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/images/dsc01756.jpg" />The theme at my son&#8217;s preschool last week was Caterpillars, and it also happened to be his turn to bring the snack (the kids rotate through this task, bring snacks/juice for 16 people)&#8230; so my wife went all-out and baked these breadstick-larva creations&#8230;</p>

<p><img align="left" src="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/images/dsc01763.jpg" />&#8230; and these butterfly cookies. Recipe for the breadstick/caterpillars is <a href="http://familycrafts.about.com/od/creativesnacks/r/caterpilrecipe.htm" target="_blank">here</a></p>

<p>Very yummy and supposedly quite well received by the kids&#8230;</p>
