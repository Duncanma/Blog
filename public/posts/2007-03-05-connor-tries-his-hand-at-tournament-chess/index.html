    <p>My son, Connor (6 years old), has been playing chess against me for the past year or so&#8230; but not very often really, maybe one or two games a month at the most. A local chess club held a chess tournament on February 24th at a nearby elementary school and Connor thought that would be pretty cool, so he entered. I have to admit, I was pretty worried that this would turn him off of chess, because he was really set on winning a trophy. I hate to be negative, but I didn&rsquo;t really expect him to get a trophy and since&nbsp;he had to play five games over the course of a very long day (for a kid), I thought he&rsquo;d end up pretty frustrated if he lost most of his games. Well, I guess I shouldn&rsquo;t have been worried; he didn&rsquo;t seem to mind at all when he lost, he was happy and focus for the whole day&#8230; and he ended up winning three of his five games, and placing 3rd for his grade level (Kindergarten).</p>

<p>I guess we&rsquo;ll be playing more chess going forward&#8230;. good thing a Chess game ships with Vista ðŸ™‚</p>
