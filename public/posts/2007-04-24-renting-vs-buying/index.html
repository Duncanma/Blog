    <p>I own a lot of Xbox and Xbox 360 games&#8230; some good, some bad&#8230; but the hit/miss ratio is much better for all my 360 games, mostly because of game renting. Starting around the time the 360 launched, I signed up for Gamefly&nbsp;and I&#8217;ve alternated between the two and three game plans. It is definitely a good deal for me, I usually only rent my second tier list of games, ones that I think I&#8217;ll like but I&#8217;m not already positive I&#8217;ll buy. Sometimes I even rent games that I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ll never ever buy, just because I want to try them out. I suppose you could do the same with Blockbuster or some other store, but I&#8217;m big into these &#8216;send to my house&#8217; programs (like Netflix&#8230;. did you know they have <a href="http://rss.netflix.com/AtHomeRSS?id=P1919270839112012058970361825810643" target="_blank" class="broken_link">RSS that shows you what movies I currently have at home</a>?). At one point, right after launch, I added every 360 game to the list, which lead to checking out some games I would never have purchased (like Rumble Roses!). I find it especially useful for kids games, because the quality can really vary on those, and sometimes Xbox Live demos aren&#8217;t really enough for me to decide if I like a game or not.</p>

<p>Occasionally I&#8217;ve even gone ahead and purchased the game through Gamefly, which is usually a pretty good price&#8230; you keep the game you have so you already know that it isn&#8217;t scratched up and that it is working well in your 360 (and if it isn&#8217;t working well, don&#8217;t buy that one!). Overall, it is my way of playing more games, without paying $60 bucks for each one and possibly ending up with a copy of Over G Fighters on my shelf.</p>

<p>Interested in checking it out yourself (they do Wii, Xbox 1 and PS2/3 games too)? Here&#8217;s <a href="http://friends.GameFly.com/r/44a16bec43c7102a919d" target="_blank" class="broken_link">my &#8216;sign up a friend link&#8217;</a> and here is <a href="http://www.gamefly.com/" target="_blank">one without any additional stuff on it</a>&#8230; use whichever one you&#8217;d prefer ðŸ™‚</p>
