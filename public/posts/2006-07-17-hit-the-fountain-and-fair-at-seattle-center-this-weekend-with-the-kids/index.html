Played in the fountain, ate some hotdogs and did a few rides (very few) at the fair that sits below the Space Needle (you can see the needle in the back of this shot).
My high-point of the trip? When my son looked over a perfect stranger in line (a guy, probably around my age&#8230; no kids with him) and asked for a bite of his cotton candy."/>

<p>Played in the fountain, ate some hotdogs and did a few rides (very few) at the fair that sits below the Space Needle (you can see the needle in the back of this shot).</p>

<p>My high-point of the trip? When my son looked over a perfect stranger in line (a guy, probably around my age&#8230; no kids with him) and asked for a bite of his cotton candy. Well, after a look at me to make sure it was ok, the dude pulled the plastic bag off the top of his cotton candy so that Connor could grab a previously untouched piece and Connor got his first taste of pure sugar in stringy/fluffy form.</p>

<p>Now, I don&#8217;t want my son to be all weird about strangers but I did mention to him later that asking strangers for candy is not normally a good idea&#8230; although I&#8217;m less concerned about folks that he <strong>asks</strong> for candy, compared to someone who offers ðŸ™‚</p>
