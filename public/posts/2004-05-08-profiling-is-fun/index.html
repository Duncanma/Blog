    <p>Back in highschool, I cut lawns for a lot of people&#8230;. so many that it was really a summer job and kept me quite busy, and then in University I took a job laying sod for a landscape company&#8230;. kinda went from the amateur level to the professional there. Both jobs were hot, dirty and left me ready for nothing but sleep at the end of a day&#8230; but I&#8217;ve often remarked to my wife that sometimes I long for that type of job. When you arrived at a site or a yard, it was in a bad state&#8230; it was an untidy lawn or perhaps a bare field of dirt&#8230; and at the end of the work it looked better. Not just a little bit better, but &#8220;very noticable by anyone walking by&#8221; better. I often work weeks on projects that don&#8217;t produce that clear of a result&#8230; it may be better in some way, but passers-by would be hard pressed to say how&#8230; or it might not be visibly better at all, it is just cleaner under the surface or slightly more efficient&#8230;.</p>

<p>Do I want to go back to mowing lawns or weilding a sod knife? No, but I do enjoy it when I get to work on something that fits into that model&#8230; a clear pile of work in front of me, and a noticeable result at the end. Development can be like that, although it often isn&#8217;t, which may be why I enjoy it so much&#8230; but lately I get to spend less and less time coding. <strong>Well, that brings me to the actual thought that started this post; profiling is fun.</strong></p>

<p>I downloaded and installed the <a href="http://www.compuware.com/media.asp?cid=3019X36">DevPartner Profiler Community Edition</a>{.broken_link} ages ago, but today I started it up and then ran through a basic usage simulation of a line of business application. Quit the app and, after a bit of chugging, I had my &#8220;pile of work&#8221;; a list of the method calls where my program spent most of its execution time&#8230; with # of calls, average time per call, and %s of the whole session&#8217;s time that was spent in this routine. This is all standard profiling information, but I have to admit that most of my heavy duty profiling has been done against SQL calls&#8230; using the beautiful combo of the Query Analyzer and the SQL Server Profiler. With this profiler, I was able to focus my perf work&#8230; look at each of the most expensive calls and in many cases make them take <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> the time. Eventually the top few methods in the list started to reflect only calls that are pretty much IO bound, which is what I expected to find. I know what&nbsp;some folks would say,&nbsp;that instead of just focusing on the worst offenders&nbsp;I should just improve all of my code, right? Probably, but I only have a little bit of time to spend on this&#8230;. and the profiling allowed me to make the most of that time.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is old news to anyone who has used a profiler (.NET or otherwise), but the community edition profiler is available for free at <a href="http://www.compuware.com/media.asp?cid=3019X36" target="_blank" class="broken_link"><a href="http://www.compuware.com/media.asp?cid=3019X36">http://www.compuware.com/media.asp?cid=3019X36</a></a>, and it is worth a try if you don&#8217;t already have a profiling system in place (and doing &#8220;debug.writeline(DateTime.Now())&#8221; at the start and end of each function doesn&#8217;t count).</p>
