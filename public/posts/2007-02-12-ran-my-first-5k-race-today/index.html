    <p>Back in the summer I jumped back into fitness by signing up for the <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> program at the Pro Club. <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> is a serious weight loss program that involves both diet change (I&#8217;d characterize it as South Beach in style) and five workouts a week (including three with a personal trainer). Well, it has been quite successful so far, bringing my weight down from around 189 to about 160 over the past 5 months, and it has had the side affect of getting me back into running.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been running off and on for a long time, but ever since I put on a bunch of weight, I&#8217;ve never really felt like I could run all that fast or for very long. (Depending on your own running experience, I still can&#8217;t run very fast or for very long, but it is all relative) Now, I&#8217;ve been running three or four miles a day, five days a week and my pace has been steadily improving. So with that feeling of increased confidence, I signed up for a 5K race this weekend, <a href="http://www.promotionevents.com/events/events-07/Valentines/home.htm" target="_blank" class="broken_link">the Valentine&#8217;s Love &#8217;em or Leave &#8217;em at Greenlake</a>.</p>

<p>It was quite an experience for me, I had never run a race like this before and I really wasn&#8217;t prepared for the number of people who running at the same time. Thirteen hundred people, that&#8217;s a lot of&nbsp;post-race bananas.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/msteechur/386871224/" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/174/386871224_f53e235763_m_d.jpg" align="left" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>It was amazingly organized, considering, and the start went really smooth (as far as I know&#8230; first time doing this), it only took about 30 seconds after the &#8216;gun&#8217; to cross the actual start line&#8230; not bad, considering how many people were in front of me.</p>

<p>My finish time was <a href="http://onlineraceresults.com/race/view_race.php?race_id=4729&submit_action=select_result&re_NO=512" target="_blank">27:45</a>, which was a bit disappointing, I had expected the competition would kick my speed up so that I could at least match the time I&#8217;ve been getting on the treadmill lately (I ran 3 miles in around 26 minutes a few days before), but I ended up running a very consistent nine minute mile (8:56) on each of the three miles. I think the real problem was that&nbsp;I didn&#8217;t end up doing much of a final kick, I really should have jumped my speed up for that last mile. Overall though, I did run for the full 5K,&nbsp;I set a time close to what I expected,&nbsp;and now I have a &#8216;baseline&#8217; to compare against for the next one.</p>
