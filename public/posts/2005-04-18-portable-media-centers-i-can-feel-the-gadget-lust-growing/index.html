    <p>Everytime <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brianjo" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Brian</a> tells me something that involves his <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/portablemediacenter/default.mspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">portable media center</a>, I think about getting one. He has <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000294HDU/duncanmackenz-20?creative=327641&#038;camp=14573&#038;link_code=as1" target="_blank">the Samsung model</a>, which I really like the look/feel of and it seems to work well (although the length of transcoding is a reoccuring complaint), but my only real plan for getting one was to sign up with <a href="http://www.pvps4free.com/default.aspx?r=160508" target="_blank">pvps4free.com</a> (only 3 away from completion!), which has <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002J6GLG/duncanmackenz-20?creative=327641&#038;camp=14573&#038;link_code=as1" target="_blank">the Creative portable media center</a>, but not the Samsung one.</p>

<p>What that site does have though, is an option where you can choose money (PayPal, but that is basically real money&#8230; you can even have it transferred into a chequing account) instead of an actual product, which means that one could, if one so desired, pick the money option and then go and buy the Samsung device.</p>

<p>The problem is, that scenario is a very different action in terms of family budgeting. I mean, saying to my wife&#8230; &#8220;I signed up on this site and I ended up with a $400 gadget&#8221; is one thing&#8230; saying, &#8220;I had $450 in my hand and I could have used it for anything&#8230; and I bought this gadget&#8230;&#8221; is quite a different situation. Hmm&#8230;. maybe the Creative one isn&#8217;t as big as it seems?</p>
