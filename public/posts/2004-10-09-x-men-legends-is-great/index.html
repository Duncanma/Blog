    <p>I&#8217;ve been playing through x-men legends for the XBox, which has been a lot of fun&#8230; kinda like Gauntlet but with the X-Men &#8230; it isn&#8217;t as much fun right now though, because I went and got stuck ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>We are trying to save Colussus from the Nuclear Facility, and we found out what we needed to do, and found the spots where we needed to weld some brackets back together (doesn&#8217;t it sound like a cool game?), but can&#8217;t seem to figure out how to do it (tried lightning, Cyclops optic blasts, Magma&#8230; even Iceman!!). Trying over and over again is frustrating with my son sitting there, but perhaps I&#8217;ll have to work at it on my own when he&#8217;s asleep.</p>

<p>Anyone else playing it? Enjoying it?</p>
