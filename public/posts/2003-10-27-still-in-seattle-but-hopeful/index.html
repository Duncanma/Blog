    <p>I&#8217;m still at SeaTac, but I&#8217;ve given up on my flight to LA (which could turn out to be a mistake, but at this point&#8230; it isn&#8217;t a big risk) and I have a seat on a flight to another city in California (Palm Springs)&#8230; then it is time to rent a vehicle and head for LA&#8230; should be an interesting night. While I&#8217;m sitting here, I&#8217;ve been getting updates from a variety of MSFT folks who are here, those who are already in LA&#8230; and those that are stuck in other cities. Kent is stuck in Portland&#8230; Mike Amundsen is on his way to the airport, with hope but not guaranteed of anything into LAX&#8230; Andy Oakley is going to go to to Palm Springs with me and another couple of MSDN folks. Should be interesting.</p>

<p>Talked to Brian Johnson, who is already in LA, and he asked me the most important question to ask when someone is stuck in an airport for hours&#8230;</p>
