<p>Just yesterday I spotted an old dusty lamp and begun to clean it.</p>

<p>With my greatest surprise a geni[e] popped out offering to fullfill a wish. Being a train lover and wishing to visit the USA I asked for a rail bridge across the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>The geni[e] got sad and said [to]me: &#8220;Sorry but did you consider the amount of material needed for the bridge, the tectonic shift not counting the<br />
fact that one should get Europeans to agree on a common electric power supply and on the environmental impact, please ask me something<br />
different&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>So I thought for a while and asked &#8220;I want a ps3 in europe this xmas&#8221; and then the geni[e] asked &#8220;Single or double track bridge sir ?&#8221;</p>
