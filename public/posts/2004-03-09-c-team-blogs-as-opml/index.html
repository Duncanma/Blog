<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/gusperez/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Gus Perez</a> has been maintaining <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/gusperez/archive/2004/03/07/85698.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">an up-to-date list of C# team blogs</a>, but after carefully duplicating his categorization in <a href="http://www.sharpreader.net" target="_blank">SharpReader</a>, I thought I would try putting it up as an OPML file&#8230;</p>

<p>You can grab it from <a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/csharpteam.xml" target="_blank" class="broken_link">here</a>, and import it into your RSS Aggregator of choice&#8230; enjoy</p>

<p>_(oh, and I ran into the oddest behaviour when posting this&#8230; putting the file up as .opml was causing IE to crash when I tried to view it, Front Page was refusing to edit it and <strong>I have no idea why</strong>. While, I enjoy questing after the truth as much as the next geek, after a few minutes of this I just gave up and made it a .xml file, which worked perfectly in all respects)</p>
