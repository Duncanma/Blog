    <p>As a parent of a 2yr old, I don&#8217;t get out to see bands as often as I used to (I know it is certainly possible, but we are not really connected into a babysitting network, so we only go out when family is visiting)&#8230; but it turns out that all you need is a toddler and to live in the right city.</p>

<p>I went out to University Village on the weekend to hang out, buy a book on grilling (new house has me out on the patio a bit more than usual), get some Ben and Jerry&#8217;s ice cream&#8230; and I ended up spending an hour in a little playground in the middle of the place. <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Dederer">Dave Dreder</a> (from the Presidents of the United States of America) was there with his daughter (and Dave&#8217;s son, but he wasn&#8217;t playing, he was hanging out in the stroller) and as we watched our kids play we ended up talking about gender differences from the earliest ages (I don&#8217;t have any particular interest in big trucks, why does my son love them?), their upcoming album (sorry no link, it isn&#8217;t published yet&#8230;) and some of their upcoming local shows.</p>

<p>Cool stuff, small world, etc.</p>

<p>On a related note, though certainly not a recent event, on New Year&#8217;s Eve my brother and I went out to <a href="http://www.kingcountyjournal.com/sited/story/html/116439">a Presidents&#8217; concert</a>{.broken_link} at <a href="http://www.thecrocodile.com/">the Crocodile Cafe</a>, with a bunch of opening acts (<a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/popmusicnightlife/134859889_soundoff01.html">the Divorce</a>{.broken_link}, The Fitness and <a href="http://www.coldcrushrecords.com/artists.html">Anna Oxygen</a>{.broken_link})&#8230;. it seemed very Seattle to both of us, a perfect concert for someone who is relatively new to the area, though I suspect my view of the Seattle music scene is a bit behind the times ðŸ™‚</p>
