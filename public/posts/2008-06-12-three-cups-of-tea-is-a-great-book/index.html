For the most part, I read magazines and watched movies, but my wife also brought me the book &ldquo;Three Cups of Tea&rdquo; about Greg Mortenson&rsquo;s work in Pakistan building schools for the children of poor rural areas. Mr. Mortenson, an avid mountain climber, ended up spending time in a small village near the base of K2 in Pakistan, barely making it down alive after a failed attempt to reach the summit. Spending time with those people made quite an affect on him and from that point on he was on a mission to build schools and otherwise help out the people of that area. The book is great reading, dealing with exciting events, perilous adventures and important issues &hellip; all taking place in an area of the world that is completely foreign to many of us.
