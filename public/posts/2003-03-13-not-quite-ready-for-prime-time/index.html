<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="teal">I have a lot of<br /> code hanging around, and the techniques in that code would likely<br /> help&nbsp;people who are getting started with .NET, but I haven&#8217;t had to time to<br /> &#8220;polish&#8221; it up for public release&#8230;</font></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="teal">I&#8217;m starting to wonder, with the rapid<br /> pace of technology, if I should just release things as they are and tweak later<br /> if I have time&#8230; at least they will provide some benefit to some people. If I<br /> wait until I get around to tidying them up, the need for these samples might be<br /> less&#8230; hmm&#8230; I just hate posting code that I&#8217;ve never polished, it is like<br /> having company over without cleaning up. Thoughts?</font></p>
