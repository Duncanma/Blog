Still, it has turned out to be pretty useful. They are running a deal now where you can get a free trial if you sign up through <a href="http://www.audible.com/tellAFriend/525878FTZ22J" target="_blank">this link</a>, so if you are interested you can probably get a couple of downloads to check out before committing to anything long term.</p>
