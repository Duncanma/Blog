<p>This article, the third in a six-part series on data structures in the .NET Framework, looks at a common data structure that is not included in the .NET Framework Base Class Library: binary trees. Whereas arrays arrange data linearly, binary trees can be envisioned as storing data in two dimensions. A special kind of binary tree, called a binary search tree, or BST, allows for a much more optimized search time than with arrays.</p>
