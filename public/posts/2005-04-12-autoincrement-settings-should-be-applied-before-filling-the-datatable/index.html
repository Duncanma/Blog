    <p>I ran into a problem recently, where duplicate IDs were being generated by my offline ADO.NET code&#8230; and I had no real idea why this was happening. I had set up the primary key of my DataTable to have the following propery values:</p>

<ul>
<li>AutoIncrement = true</li>
<li>AutoIncrementSeed = -1</li>
<li>AutoIncrementStep = -1</li>
</ul>

<p>This is supposed to result in offline IDs being assigned as -1,-2,-3 and therefore having no possibility of conflict with any <strong>real</strong> IDs used in the database. This has worked great for me on many occasions, so it was a bit of a surprise when I finally tracked down my problem to the IDs that were being assigned to my new rows. I put a break point right after calling NewRow on the DataTable and the newly created Row had a PK value of 141. Another new row and it would have a value of 140, and so on&#8230; it seems the AutoIncrementStep was working, but the seed value was wonky.</p>

<p>I asked around and was told to make sure that I was setting the AutoIncrement properties <strong>before</strong> filling the table, which it turns out I wasn&#8217;t doing. What I had for code was basically like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>If table doesn&#8217;t exist in DataSet, set a flag to true indicating that this is the first call to the data load</li>
<li>Fill the table</li>
<li>Check the flag and setup the table, including setting the AutoIncrement properties</li>
</ol>

<p>With the new guidance I had received, I changed the routine to:</p>

<ol>
<li>If table doesn&#8217;t exist in DataSet, set a flag to true indicating that this is the first call to the data load</li>
<li>Fill the table&#8217;s schema (FillSchema), to get the columns and the PK</li>
<li>Check the flag and setup the table, including setting the AutoIncrement properties</li>
<li>Fill the table</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, all this could be made simpler/cleaner if I built up the schema &#8216;manually&#8217; before loading the table&#8217;s data but I&#8217;m way too lazy for that.</p>
