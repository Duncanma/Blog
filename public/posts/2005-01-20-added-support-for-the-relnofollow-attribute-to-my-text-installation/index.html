<p><a href="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Google and various blog software vendors recently announced a method to deter comment spam</a> by reducing its benefit to the spammer&#8230; it sounds like a pretty good idea, so I updated my installation of .Text to use this new attribute in the comment section by adding just a single line within comments.cs: namelink.Attributes[&#8220;rel&#8221;] = &#8220;nofollow&#8221;; &#8230; now, let&#8217;s just hope it works ðŸ˜‰</p>

<p>I think I might enhance this a bit later, adding the idea of approved comments that don&#8217;t get this attribute for their links, since I see no reason why a non-spammer&#8217;s comment shouldn&#8217;t give them google-juice. That feature is likely a ways into the future, but you never know.</p>
