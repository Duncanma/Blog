<p>We&#8217;ve just updated <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=86CE6052-D7F4-4AEB-9B7A-94635BEEBDDA&#038;displaylang=en" target="_blank">the CLRProfiler distribution</a>. Once again, we&#8217;re shipping both the source and the prebuilt binaries, and this time we&#8217;re delighted to include a terrific ~100 page tutorial and reference manual written by the tool&#8217;s author, Peter Sollich. </p></p>

<p>I think this new documentation greatly enhances the power and utility of the profiler by demonstrating how to use its features more effectively &#8212; for example, how to diagnose a memory leak. </ul></p>

<p>Definitely a tool you want to get, I know the early version rocked, so this must be even better ðŸ™‚</p>
