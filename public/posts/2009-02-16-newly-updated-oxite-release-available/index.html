<p><img class="inlineImage" alt="bring me the lavender frog!" src="http://duncanmackenzie.net/content/icons/frog.png" /><a href="http://erikporter.com/">Erik</a> pushed out <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/oxite/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=23315">a new release to Oxite</a> today, the first since January 5th. This release is an important one, because it reflects a great deal of changes made in response to internal and external feedback about our initial release.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>A lot of work went into these changes; they were the primary focus of <a href="http://erikporter.com/">Erik</a>, <a href="http://sampy.com/">Sampy</a>{.broken_link} and <a href="http://nathan.heskew.com/">Nathan</a> for the past 4+ weeks. <a href="http://codeplex.com/Unity">Unity</a> was implemented to provide Dependency Injection, <a href="http://codeplex.com/xunit">xUnit</a> was used as the test runner to remove a dependency on the higher level SKUs of Visual Studio, and a great deal of work was put into restructuring our data layer to completely abstract the Linq 2 SQL code from our actual objects. Like most software projects, there is always more work that could be done, and we will be making changes and additions as we continue to use this code for our work projects and for our personal sites.</p>
