    <p>It&#8217;s been a few days since the big storm blew through, but I&#8217;m still without power (I&#8217;m at Microsoft now, so I can get connected and charge a few things)&#8230; which sucks when you have kids (and visitors, my in-laws arrived on the night of the storm). We aren&#8217;t too cold now, we&#8217;ve borrowed a propane heater from a friend and we have a gas stove to boil water on for coffee/tea (and to boil hotdogs with!).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/duncanma/326944658/" title="Photo Sharing"><img style="margin: 10px" height="180" alt="DSC00041" src="http://static.flickr.com/140/326944658_454577007d_m.jpg" width="240" align="left" border="0" /></a>The storm itself ripped through our area with a fair amount of damage, taking down one of the biggest trees in the area right across the street from us, and knocking down one of the evergreens in our own yard. No damage to our house, but the big tree across the street managed to clip a house on the way down and tear a hole in it&#8217;s roof. Fun stuff.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/54156810@N00/sets/72157594423999231/" target="_blank">Lots of photos on Flickr about this&#8230;</a></p>

<p>Right now, I just want power&#8230; the majority of folks in the Puget Sound have power back, but our area is listed as &#8216;one of the most severely damaged&#8217; and we aren&#8217;t expected to have power restored for another 3 to 5 days. The kids are holding up great, but on today, day 4 without power, the adults are becoming quite testy&#8230;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m holding onto hope that power will snap back on before the estimated times they&#8217;ve given us, assuming those times are &#8216;worst case&#8217; guesses. Of course, the kids are safe and warm under the blankets at home&#8230; I&#8217;m at the office with the Starbucks iCup in full working order&#8230; things aren&#8217;t really too bad.</p>
