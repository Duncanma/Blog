Well I was puzzled because, while we don&#8217;t ship out DVD quality video, our high quality download is quite good for a podcast. Turns out though, after installing TV Tonic and picking on10.net out of their catalog, that the feed they have in their system is our 512kbps WMV feed&#8230; which is certainly not the best quality around, around 430kbps for video and 320&#215;240&#8230; fine for display on our site, but not the hottest around&#8230; instead they should be using our WMV (high quality) feed (2500 kbps, 640 x 480), but I have no idea how to tell them about it."/>
