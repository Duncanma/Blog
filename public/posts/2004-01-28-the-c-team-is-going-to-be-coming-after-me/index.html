    <p>Every week, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu" target="_blank">Eric Gunnerson</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Dan Fernandez</a> and I get together to work on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp" target="_blank">the C# developer center</a> and other C#-ish topics&#8230; and last week we divided up some tasks amongst the three of us. Well, we are meeting again today and I don&#8217;t have those tasks done&#8230; so I&#8217;m starting to watch my back.</p>

<p><img src="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/art/csharp_team.gif" border="0" /></p>

<p>I&#8217;m expecting Andy (above) to show up in my office at any moment with the C# &#8216;club of motivation&#8217;, but perhaps I can save myself before he arrives&#8230; with your help.</p>

<p>My task was to come up with a good set of questions that we could ask all of our MVPs as part of a &#8220;meet the MVPs&#8221; section of the developer center. Here&#8217;s some of the questions I have so far;</p>

<ul>
<li>How did you get into programming/computers?</li>
<li>What is your favorite feature or area of C#?</li>
<li>What C# or .NET newsgroups or forums do you spend most of your time in?</li>
<li>Where would you recommend a C# developer look for answers, code samples, etc&#8230;?</li>
<li>Do you have any recommendations for books on C#, .NET or related topics?</li>
<li>When you aren&#8217;t answering questions on the web, what do you do as your day job?</li>
</ul>

<p>These are sounding pretty bland to me so far, so I am hoping you can help me out and supply a few suggestions. What would you like to ask some of these MVPs?</p>

<p>What about someone from the C# or .NET product team? We are also planning to conduct some interviews with them, so let me know what you would want to ask a C# team member and I&#8217;ll try my best to get your questions onto our list.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m going to go back under my desk and wait for a friendly visit from a C# team member&#8230;.</p>
