<p><img src="http://www.mp3players4free.com/images/products/96.jpg" align="right" title="Creative Zen Micro" border="0" />Of course, the iPod has been available (and widely publicized) through these free sites for a while (<a href="http://www.FreeiPodShuffle.com/?r=14790940" target="_blank">shuffle</a>, <a href="http://www.freeiPods.com/?r=14756414" target="_blank">regular/mini</a>, or <a href="http://www.freephotoiPods.com/?r=14863034" target="_blank" class="broken_link">photo model</a> all have their own sites), but if you are like me and you want to use a media player that works with more than one brand of device, or if you want to stick with WMA (I have ripped 15 GB of my music into that format, and it works great with <a href="http://www.digitalnetworksna.com/rioaudio/default.asp?cat=35" target="_blank">my Rio Nitrus and wife&#8217;s Rio Cali</a>&#8230; so I&#8217;m sticking there for the forseeable future!), then <a href="http://www.creative.com/zenmicro/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">the Zen Micro</a> might be worth taking a look.</p>
