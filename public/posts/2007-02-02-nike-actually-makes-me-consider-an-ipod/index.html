    <p>If you know me, or read my blog much, you&#8217;ll probably gather that I&#8217;ve fully bought into the WMA/WMV world. I&#8217;ve always been a bit annoyed at the iPod model of things as well&#8230; I mean, seriously, you can only use iTunes with iPods and iPods with iTunes&#8230; talk about crazy&#8230; people need choice, who wants to be locked into one music player or one music store?!?</p>

<p>Of course, I don&#8217;t get to rant about that anymore, now that we are doing the exact same thing with <a href="http://www.zune.net/" target="_blank">Zune</a>&#8230; I don&#8217;t like it any better just because we are doing it, but I&#8217;ve decided that I must be in the minority and that most consumers must not really care about being locked into a single store/brand.</p>

<p>Anyway, the long and short of this is that I would never consider an iPod, all of my media is firmly sitting in the Windows Media world. I have an Xbox 360, a Media Center PC, a Portable Media Center device, a Zune, an iRiver Clix and my wife has a Napster-to-go subscription. Yep, I&#8217;m in the Windows Media world alright.</p>

<p>But then I see <a href="http://www.nike.com/nikeplus/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">this</a>, and I really want it. I&#8217;ve been writing down my run distances and times onto a piece of paper for the past two weeks, and now I was going to find some form of online log to input them into&#8230; and my search brought me to the very fancy <a href="http://www.nike.com/nikerunning" target="_blank" class="broken_link">NikeRunning.com</a> site. And from there, I ended up viewing <a href="http://www.nikeplus.com/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">NikePlus.com</a> &#8230; bugger!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/images/WindowsLiveWriter/NikeactuallymakesmeconsideraniPod_C11D/NikeRunning%5B4%5D.png" rel="lightbox[579]" title="Nike+ actually makes me consider an iPod"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="154" src="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/images/WindowsLiveWriter/NikeactuallymakesmeconsideraniPod_C11D/NikeRunning_thumb%5B4%5D.png" width="380" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think I can do it, it would end up being just for running, and that is an expensive package just to run with&#8230; but it is very tempting.</p>
