    <p>For quite some time I&#8217;ve thought Pageviews were a mostly useless number to be tracking for any web site. This was very clear at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com">MSDN</a>, where such stats are tracked very carefully&#8230; spreadsheets are created&#8230; charts are made&#8230; and yet, none of us really believed in the Pageview #s. Instead we used to focus more on unique visitors or an odd calculated value we called unique page views (not everyone&#8217;s definition of that # is the same, but suffice it to say that is an attempt to more accurately represent real site visits by real people).</p>

<p>RSS is one reason why PageViews are useless, site design considerations are another (if high page views are a goal, then reducing the # of clicks for a user to get from your home page to an article becomes a bad thing&#8230; when it should a wonderful thing).</p>

<p>I found <a href="http://evhead.com/2006/08/pageviews-are-obsolete.asp" target="_blank">a great article today</a>, via <a href="http://del.icio.us/alexbarn" target="_blank">Alex Barnett&#8217;s deli.cio.us links</a>, on this exact topic.</p>
