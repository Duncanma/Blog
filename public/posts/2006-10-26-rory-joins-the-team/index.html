<p>&#8220;My apartment is very nice, but the complex in which it is situated is a tad on the trashy side. I expected to find a just-add-water meth lab in the kitchen of my corporate apartment. It would have provided me a way to fit in and make friends with the neighbors, but alas and alack, such luck was not to be mine. I wasn&#8217;t even provided a gun.&#8221; &#8212; From <a href="http://neopoleon.com/home/blogs/neo/archive/2006/10/19/22315.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Rory&#8217;s moving day post</a></p>
