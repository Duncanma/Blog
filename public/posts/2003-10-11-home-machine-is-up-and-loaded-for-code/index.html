    <p>Kent used a phrase a few days ago &#8220;loaded for bear&#8221;, and while I can&#8217;t even really explain what it meant (though <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=%22loaded+for+bear%22">Google</a> certainly can), it makes me laugh every time I think of it&#8230;</p>

<p>Anyway, I recently bought a home machine (from Dell, because I realized that if I built it myself I would probably spend weeks doing it for 20-30 minutes a night), and I&#8217;ve finally loaded it up with VS.NET 2003.</p>

<p>The motivation behind the purchase of a new home computer was that I would spend less time in the middle of night working on the more mundane aspects of my job, and more time on my writing and coding&#8230; but all I had managed to install was Outlook and enough other software to be able to work on the developer centers&#8230; not a lot of code can be written if you don&#8217;t install an IDE though (<a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx">well, unless you are into emacs</a>{.broken_link}) so now I&#8217;m ready to go. Assuming I can stay up late enough over the next few weeks, I should be able to get back on track with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/using/columns/code4fun/default.aspx">my column</a>{.broken_link}, and perhaps write a few stand-alone samples that folks will find interesting. Of course, I bought Halo for the PC today, and the Titans add-on for Age of Mythology&#8230; I wonder how long I can leave them in the boxes?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to PDC week, we&#8217;ll be putting a ton of new and interesting content up on MSDN&#8230; lots to read even if you aren&#8217;t going to LA yourself. One of those pieces of content is a chapter from my next book, so I&#8217;m pretty excited to get that posted onto <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc">MSDN</a>&#8230; despite the heavy temptation to just stick it up on <a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/">www.duncanmackenzie.net</a>&#8230;</p>
