Of course, I&#8217;ve just added this to my forked version of Kent&#8217;s original code&#8230; so any feature I add that he likes will need to manually added into his version&#8230; bad software development practice, but hey we&#8217;re just playing around here so you should be expecting too much."/>

    <p>Nick, from &#8220;<a href="http://thecodingmonkey.blogspot.com" target="_blank">The Coding Monkey</a>&#8221; mentioned that he would like to see Atom support in the <a href="http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2005/10/15/3101.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">FlairMaker</a>, so &#8230; having no real reason not to, and having an extra 15 minutes after the kids went to sleep before I started cleaning up the house, I added it&#8230;</p>

<p>Of course, I&#8217;ve just added this to my forked version of <a href="http://www.acmebinary.com/blogs/kent/archive/2005/10/07/273.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Kent&#8217;s original code</a>&#8230; so any feature I add that he likes will need to manually added into his version&#8230; bad software development practice, but hey we&#8217;re just playing around here so you should be expecting too much.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I also modified the code to pull the blog&#8217;s title from the feed (Atom or RSS) and stick it at the bottom. Not that useful of a feature for the Coding 4 Fun version, since it is always pointing at the same feed&#8230; but useful for mine if people want to use it for their own feeds</p>
