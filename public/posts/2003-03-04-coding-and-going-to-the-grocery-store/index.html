<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="teal">Greg Robinson&#8217;s <a href="http://dotnetweblogs.com/grobinson/posts/3388.aspx" class="broken_link">comments</a> today<br /> were quite timely, I had been thinking much the same thing myself&#8230; Often, and<br /> I find it happens more and more these days, I will go to find something on the<br /> Internet, or buy something at the grocery store, and I end up doing everything<br /> but the task I intended to accomplish. This appears to be normal human<br /> behaviour, but it can be quite disturbing if you are short on time and have a<br /> lot of things that need to get done. As <a href="http://dotnetweblogs.com/DNeimke" class="broken_link">Darren</a> comments on Greg&#8217;s post, a<br /> to-do list appears to be the only way to keep yourself focused. In coding this<br /> is extremely important, so I use bug-tracking software to track new features and<br /> bug fixes together with some priority info&#8230; otherwise I would code for a few<br /> days and never get any closer to shipping out my application.</font></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="teal">I suspect that we could all use more<br /> focus to the work part of our day, the more productive we are at work, the more<br /> we can goof-off at home! I&#8217;ve always wondered if there was a software solution<br /> to this problem, but I think it much more of an issue with me than with any<br /> particular means for tracking to-do&#8217;s. A piece of paper would likely be enough<br /> of a &#8220;system&#8221; for tracking all of the things to do in a day, but like most<br /> developers I feel compelled to at least use a computer solution (Outlook tasks<br /> at the moment, at least they sync to my pda), although I have a strong desire to<br /> write my own. I guess that would be the ultimate procrastination, writing your<br /> own to-do list tool instead of actually working on the items on your<br /> list.</font></p>
