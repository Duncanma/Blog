    <p>Ok, you&#8217;ll be glad to hear that I won&#8217;t be whining any more about not having an Xbox 360. My pre-order from EB Games <strong>still</strong> hasn&#8217;t come in, but a friend of mine knew someone who had waited in line to get a 360 on launch day and then had their pre-order come in&#8230; so they were willing to sell me their second Xbox 360 at cost. Lucky me, I picked it up yesterday and took it home, then set it up after the kids were in bed. So far, all I&#8217;ve done is play Hexic and Gauntlet, and download a bunch of movie trailers (in 720p, sweet!). I have DOA 4, so that will be the next thing to try whenever I have time&#8230; then I need to figure out what game will be my next acquisition. #1 and #2 on <a href="http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2005/11/05/3206.aspx" target="_blank" class="broken_link">my &#8220;list&#8221;</a> aren&#8217;t out yet, so &#8230; probably Kameo?</p>
