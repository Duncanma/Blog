      <description>I think I have to blame Kent Sharkey&amp;nbsp;for this; he put up his blog and it has been nagging at my mind for days now&amp;#8230; &amp;#8220;I should have a blog&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;hey I think I have something to say&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230; but I couldn&amp;#8217;t decide on the implemenation details&amp;#8230; should I build my own blog tool, use a site like http://blogger.com, or radio.userland?

      <description>Doesn&amp;#8217;t anyone use static web pages anymore? I was playing
around with some code, just doing a quick prototype of an app for my Coding4Fun column and
(inspired by the cool and useful PAINT  tool) I decided to create an app that would check
for changes to a website and give you a little quick-launch menu of updated sites
on your system tray (who couldn&amp;#8217;t use one more icon there?</description>

      <description>Every time I go to
a computer/electronics store I consider buying some mini-CD-Rs,
but I have absolutely no reason to get them. But, I still look at them every
time. I just want to burn something on them. Something that would fit into
210mb, something &amp;#8220;cool&amp;#8221; to send to a friend.. I&amp;#8217;ll admit it, I just want to buy
them because they look cute.</description>

      <description>Just heard an
advertisement on the radio for the Foo Fighters and it contained this quote &amp;#8220;The world&amp;#8217;s

      <description>Whenever I shut
down my laptop, it is a very painful experience&amp;#8230; one by one I watch&amp;nbsp;a
series of programs die a painful death, as they refuse to shut down gracefully.
The error messages about &amp;#8220;Windows Stations&amp;#8221; that are closing are very useful,
but somehow the entire process (which sometimes involves clicking a few &amp;#8220;End
Task&amp;#8221; buttons, and maybe even selecting Shut Down all over again because half of
my system is still breathing) reminds me a lot of watching someone you love</description>

      <description>You can’t bind a Windows Forms DateTimePicker to a field
that might contain DBNull… so I did this;

get this anyway&amp;#8230;

Now, if they had one that was a network

I find it happens more and more these days, I will go to find something on the

      <description>Whenever I have to
code a &amp;#8220;real&amp;#8221; project, I end up building a bunch of components to deal with anything that seems
likely to reoccur. Sometimes the class or Windows Forms control I&amp;#8217;ve created
never gets used again, but often I end up using them in a whole bunch of
additional apps. Anyway, I think I&amp;#8217;ll post some of these little bits of
development work to my blog when it seems useful enough, and perhaps other</description>

code hanging around, and the techniques in that code would likely
help&amp;nbsp;people who are getting started with .NET, but I haven&amp;#8217;t had to time to
&amp;#8220;polish&amp;#8221; it up for public release&amp;#8230;

_I certainly don&amp;#8217;t want to get into a debate over this but, shouldn&amp;#8217;t the
question be: &amp;#8220;what is it best to use?&amp;#8221;. I&amp;#8217;m probably biased because I
never really programmed in any typed languages before .NET, but, to me at least,
being as explicit as possible is always a good thing.
I know that Int32
will map to System.Int32 even in version 30 of the Framework.</description>

If you build console apps that take
multiple arguments (generate.exe /vroot:vbasic /target:c:\files\ &amp;#8230; etc.) then
this{.broken_link} makes it very easy. To use it, just compile the provided code into a

      <description>I’m writing this from Las Vegas now, actually I’m on a plane heading to Las Vegas… but this post won’t show up until I’ve landed and found some form of connection, for a few days of the N+I conference (Networld + Interop), and it has been a fairly crazy few days. With a flight planned for 9:50 in the evening, my wife and I (and our 2 yr old son) thought we had some time to do a bit of house-hunting around 4 in the afternoon.</description>

      <description>Tomorrow is my last day here in Vegas, the N+I conference is wrapping up and I&amp;#8217;m going to be heading home to Redmond. Overall it was an interesting experience, I&amp;#8217;ve never attended a non-developer focused conference before and it was quite a different type of crowd then I&amp;#8217;m used to. The questions at the VS.NET 2003 booth were mostly &amp;#8220;What is &amp;#8230;. Visual Studio&amp;#8230; ?&amp;#8221; I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure some of the folks who came up to me thought it was some form of graphics editing suite, due to the Visual part of the name.</description>

      <description>A recent post{.broken_link} by Wil Wheaton manages to show his flair for descriptive writing, his complete geekness (surrender to it folks, it is the only way), and the emotions invoked when your son admires you&amp;#8230;
And it does all of this while including the word tea; what more could you ask for?

      <description>At the end of May, Oprah is coming to Seattle to do an all day workshop&amp;#8230; and I really wanted to get my wife (and a friend) tickets. Well, when the day of ordering came I was swamped and it totally slipped my mind until the evening&amp;#8230; at which point it was too late. Next stop for the desperate man, eBay&amp;#8230; lots of auctions of tickets, but once they reached up into 300 to 400% of face value, I declined to continue&amp;#8230; so, no tickets that way.</description>

      <description>Some{.broken_link} folks{.broken_link} have been discussing the idea of paying for technical work&amp;#8230; well, they are actually talking about paying for technical work done over email&amp;#8230; but what is the difference?
I need some work done, whether that is easy or hard for the person I hire isn&amp;#8217;t relevant&amp;#8230; and if they answer my question too quickly that certainly shouldn&amp;#8217;t be a problem either. So why is Jeff Julian upset by this?</description>

      <description>I recently received a question about doing some Word automation using .NET, and I saw an interesting little difference between the C# and VB.NET calling into the Interop Assembly for certain properties/methods&amp;#8230;
If I take VBA or VB6 code that works, and convert it to the almost identical VB.NET code &amp;#8230; (after adding a reference to Word in my VB.NET project);
Dim wordApp As New Word.Application() 
Dim newDoc As Word.</description>

      <description>Since starting my column{.broken_link}, I&amp;#8217;ve received quite a few requests for &amp;#8220;just the install&amp;#8221; from people who read the article, liked the app I built, but don&amp;#8217;t have any interest in the code&amp;#8230; they just want to run the app!
I never really considered that possibility, and in some cases I didn&amp;#8217;t even write the code with that in mind, but now I&amp;#8217;m wondering if I should at least provide a built install file in with the downloadable code sample for non-programmers&amp;#8230; weird thought.</description>

      <description>This recent MSDN magazine article{.broken_link} is pretty cool. Although the title suggests it is all about Zip Compression, the real power of this article is that it points out that the J# libraries are available from any .NET language, providing your C#/VB.NET apps with a lot more than just zip support (although that is pretty neat too).</description>

I didn&amp;#8217;t realize there were words for this type of thing&amp;#8230; though more words along the same theme could make for interesting, if cryptic, conversations.</description>

      <description>My wife read my blog for the first time yesterday, and she has decided that she wants to try it for herself&amp;#8230; but where to blog? dotnetweblogs is great, but this isn&amp;#8217;t going to be a tech-focused blog (is there a mommyblogs.com?). I have my own site, it even runs ASP.NET but I doubt I can do much (if anything at all) with the server config as it is running on a shared server.</description>

Of course, I&amp;#8217;d suggest that you don&amp;#8217;t run WMP9, IE, or blogging client software on your Windows Server, but I don&amp;#8217;t want to sound crazy</description>

      <description>That was what my 2-yr old son received last night&amp;#8230; ouch. We were at a birthday party for a friend of ours and there were lots of kids running around&amp;#8230; oops, Connor fell and slammed his forehead right into the corner of a wall. Cut right to the bone and bleeding like crazy. What a trooper though, he cried for a bit, mostly because of the look on all of the adult&amp;#8217;s faces, but he had stopped before I could even get him to the truck for a drive to the hospital.</description>

      <description>DonXML was discussing the various prices he has seen on the web for MSDN subscriptions, and being from MSDN I was a little curious. I asked around, and it turns out we have a canned response to this question that you might find helpful (or not).
The sheer volume and ever changing number of offers, resellers, businesses, marketing programs and selling that takes place on the global commerce stage precludes Microsoft from being in a position to validate every MSDN subscription offer in the market.</description>

      <description>This might be common knowledge, but when Darren{.broken_link} was in town he mentioned that downloading our multi-media presentations like VBTV{.broken_link} and the .NET Show was too expensive from Australia due to the price of bandwidth&amp;#8230; I had hoped to burn some to disc while he was here, but I forgot 🙁 Turns out they are on the DVD editions of the MSDN library subscription though;
For a brief summary of all seminars and presentations, with links to launch them, DVD subscribers should go to the \media\default.</description>

Lately, I haven&amp;#8217;t been getting them, something about the &amp;#8220;staff&amp;#8221; on my registration at all of these things&amp;#8230; so my laptop bag closet was getting a little empty. I give these great bags away to my friends and family, there are just too many for one person, which is why you might see my mother roaming around with a TechEd bag, or see my wife at the park with my son and a nice VSLive &amp;#8220;tote&amp;#8221;!</description>

      <description>I thought I had better write my first TechEd related post, now that I&amp;#8217;ve joined techedbloggers.net, and especially since I&amp;#8217;ve arrived in Dallas.
Nothing much to report except a minor complaint; the Hyatt Regency doesn&amp;#8217;t have high-speed Internet&amp;#8230; and that is a bit of a disappointment. Yeah, yeah, I know&amp;#8230; boo-hoo, no high-speed Internet, poor Microsoft guy. But really&amp;#8230; there are a ton of TechEd attendees here, it looks like we&amp;#8217;ve filled up the place, so I think it would have been handy for a lot of people&amp;#8230; although I&amp;#8217;m mostly just concerned about me at the moment, it just sounds better if I say I&amp;#8217;m worried about all the other attendees.</description>

      <description>A pair of Mr. Smiths (Eric and Cory) have invited me and anyone else who is into .NET to come for dinner and drinks at the Hard Rock Cafe in Dallas&amp;#8230; 7 pm Tuesday night.
I&amp;#8217;ll be there, and I hope to see a few more folks too!

      <description>Skipped out of work on Friday morning to go sea Finding Nemo with my son. He is only 2yrs old, so he probably isn’t really ready for going to movies as a general practice… but he really enjoyed it. About a month ago I was in Las Vegas and I brought him home a “Nemo” plush fish… I explained that in a month (which is a longer period of time than he can really grasp, but he knew it was “soon, but not now”) he and I would go to a movie with Nemo in it.</description>

Macro Madness

, part of the ongoing Coding 4 Fun experience!
Speaking of Coding 4 Fun, or the lack thereof&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;m sitting in a wireless lounge at TechEd, where I have spent most of my trip to Dallas&amp;#8230; doing remote troubleshooting and coding on a system back in Redmond. Not a unique experience, I&amp;#8217;m sure many of the people reading this entry have ended up working from a remote location when they expected to attend sessions or other activities&amp;#8230; but still not the best way to spend one&amp;#8217;s time.</description>

      <description>The new ASP.NET developer center has launched at http://msdn.microsoft.com/asp.net. And yes, having asp.net as a directory name is perfectly &amp;#8220;legal&amp;#8221;, even if it looks a little odd the first time you see it.

Question: I want to make sure that the txtBox is Numeric Only on &amp;#8220;Leave&amp;#8221;. I&amp;#8217;m sure a user will at eventually enter a $ into the txtBox. I want to bring up a MessageBox on &amp;#8220;Leave&amp;#8221; that will notify the user to take the $ of the txtBox and prevent further data entry until the $ is removed.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m on my way to Winnipeg, Manitoba to give a talk on No Touch Deployment with .NET; luckily I managed to find wireless access at the Vancouver airport along the way. If I had to pick one thing about .NET that justifies a move from VB6 windows applications to VB.NET Windows Forms it would have to be the ease of deployment and update using the Internet. Check out this article for more info on the whole concept of No Touch Deployment{.</description>

      <description>My last two posts mentioned two different ways of achieving similar results; deploying and updating an application over the Internet. Not suprisingly, I received a comment asking how do you determine which of the two methods to use, a very good question which I will try to answer here.
The first thing to understand is that, while the two methods have similar goals, they are different in a key respect; one deploys over the network when you run it, the other uses the network to retrieve updates.</description>

      <description>My most recent Coding 4 Fun column was just published&amp;#8230; a fairly &amp;#8220;fun&amp;#8221; example, even if it happens to do something a little &amp;#8216;odd&amp;#8217; with Remoting over SOAP. For those of you who read it; using Add Web Reference on the .NET Compact Framework side of things to connect to a Remoting server is not the recommended way to do things, but it does work in some situations and &amp;#8230; well&amp;#8230; it is pretty darn easy, so I went with it.</description>

      <description>Is now up on the web (I guess it was all up there before, just not in one place) as my interview with mainfunction.com has made it up onto their web site. I think they told me this was coming months ago, so I hope I didn&amp;#8217;t mention it to a bunch of people then, because I&amp;#8217;m betting it was only published recently.

      <description>I just uploaded a new sample to microsoft.com, pulling some useful code out of another MSDN sample that was so unrelated that I figured that this little bit of interesting code would never be found. This code sample shows how to retrieve the icon for any given file type and it does it through a pretty cool component that exposes 2 ImageLists to make it easy to use with a ListView or TreeView.</description>

I just moved into a new house, only a few minutes away from my apartment, and I called Verizon to arrange for the move of the phone and DSL (both through them). They were very nice on the phone and arranged to move both as of the 3rd of July&amp;#8230; although they had to transfer me to a 2nd person to arrange the DSL, because it seems they are essentially two different companies.</description>

      <description>As a parent of a 2yr old, I don&amp;#8217;t get out to see bands as often as I used to (I know it is certainly possible, but we are not really connected into a babysitting network, so we only go out when family is visiting)&amp;#8230; but it turns out that all you need is a toddler and to live in the right city.
I went out to University Village on the weekend to hang out, buy a book on grilling (new house has me out on the patio a bit more than usual), get some Ben and Jerry&amp;#8217;s ice cream&amp;#8230; and I ended up spending an hour in a little playground in the middle of the place.</description>

Perhaps I need to be clearer about my intent.
&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m interested in blogs that contain useful information for Visual Basic (.NET or not) developers.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8230; the fact that Brad Abrams and Chris Brumme are not tied to any one language is the whole reason why I chose to list them.</description>

      <description>I recently took an internal MSDN application that I had been running as an HREF-EXE for some months now and converted it to use the Application Updater Block{.broken_link} from PAG&amp;#8230; it ended up taking many steps, but only a couple of hours (total) to get from start to test.. so I thought I would post my experience with integrating this new block into my application.

      <description>The app I am currently working on, and the one that I just recently moved from being an href-exe to being an application that updates itself via the PAG Updater Application Block, has always been located on my own Windows XP machine, that is to say&amp;#8230; that is the web server where the .exe and other assemblies reside. Well, that causes me all sorts of problems, because it effectively makes my desktop machine into a production box, and one that many people depend upon&amp;#8230; restarting is not a possibility, and I even try to minimize the load on the box as it will tend to wreak havoc on some of my users if I fire up 2 copies of VS.</description>

      <description>Hey folks, I&amp;#8217;m not sure if you&amp;#8217;ve seen this section of the new MSDN Developer Centers (http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/letters{.broken_link}). It is a place where the appropriate MSDN Content Strategist (me for VB, Kent for ASP.NET, etc&amp;#8230;) gives a little blurb about the content on the site for that period of time&amp;#8230; it is a bit bloggish in nature in fact, but with a bit more editorial polish&amp;#8230;
Anyway, I was looking at the fairly dismal page views on this part of the vbasic site and I was wondering what would make it more appealing?</description>

      <description>Ok, I know that Paul knew this, but did anyone else notice that the VB.NET Try&amp;#8230;Catch syntax{.broken_link} includes a &amp;#8216;when&amp;#8217; clause?
Try  [ tryStatements ] [ Catch [ exception [ As type ] ] &amp;lt;u[ When expression ]&amp;lt;/u [ catchStatements ] ] [ Exit Try ] ... [ Finally [ finallyStatements ] ] End Try When
Optional. A Catch statement with a When clause will only catch exceptions when expression evaluates to True.</description>

      <description>What would you folks think if I wrote one of my MSDN articles in a serial fashion into my blog? Basically just posted each section as I wrote it? I&amp;#8217;m considering doing this for my next Coding 4 Fun article, but before I flood your aggregator with piles of text I thought I&amp;#8217;d look for some feedback&amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>Here is a teaser for the article I am currently working on&amp;#8230;
Keeping Work Fun Duncan Mackenzie
Microsoft Developer Network
August 8, 2003
Summary: Duncan Mackenzie describes how the &amp;#8216;coolness&amp;#8217; of a feature can increase its chance of being finished early on in a development project.
People Keep Making me Work If you&amp;#8217;ve been following my columns, you probably think that I spend all my time writing up fun and cool code samples without having to work on anything boring.</description>

      <description>Continuing along with the rest of the article, I start to layout the basic design of what I am about to build&amp;#8230;
Designing our New Feature As a fairly low-priority item, the request wasn&amp;#8217;t described in any more detail than that one line, but I had a pretty good idea about what folks around MSDN were looking for so I started with a rough design.
The RSS Viewer window will support the viewing of an RSS feed and the dragging of links from the feed into the rest of the system.</description>

      <description>With this final bit of text, this is the whole article&amp;#8230; before any of your comments&amp;#8230; and before my wonderful editor (Henry Borys) has attacked it. If you were to take the content from these blog entries and diff it with the published article&amp;#8230; you&amp;#8217;ll see the amazing impact that a good editor can have on your writing.
Storing and Retrieving the Feed Lists Once I had the RSS feeds displaying, and I had tested the system with enough sample data (translation: it worked against my blog&amp;#8217;s feed{.</description>

      <description>Thanks to everyone who emailed me and offered to help&amp;#8230; but the problem was time, not technical&amp;#8230; despite my joke about working on the cool stuff first, a ton of high-priority stuff has made me weeks late on my article!
Although I did hit some snags with odd unsorted feeds (MSDN&amp;#8217;s!), I managed to get everything working the way I wanted. I&amp;#8217;m still a little unhappy with the system because I don&amp;#8217;t strip out potentially bad tags from any HTML content included in the RSS (as per http://diveintomark.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been using the Application Updater Block, as you may have gathered from some of my previous posts, and I like it a lot&amp;#8230; but I&amp;#8217;ve been wanting to add a few features to it. Well, I have it all planned out in my head, but I haven&amp;#8217;t gotten around to it, so I thought I would at least throw out my feature ideas and see what people say about them&amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>I have a bunch of writing to do, but what I really want to do is code!
It turns out I have a bunch of coding to do as well&amp;#8230; but the writing is more overdue than the coding (at the moment)!
Of course, I could just say to hell with them both and go play some SW:KOTOR, but I finished it a couple of nights ago and I&amp;#8217;m not quite ready to start again&amp;#8230; although the dark path should provide some interesting replay value.</description>

      <description>Well, I haven&amp;#8217;t produced anything of staggering brillance tonight, but I&amp;#8217;m a little less behind on some of my writing obligations (now those SAMS editors will stop posting my picture in the coffee room with nasty words beneath it)&amp;#8230; still behind on 3 or 4 other projects, but progress is progress&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;m not going to complain!
Some very cool stuff coming soon on the Visual C# Developer Center, which I have recently taken over &amp;#8216;stewardship&amp;#8217; of, I&amp;#8217;ll leave it to someone else to give away details if he wants and just say that if you care at all about the C# language itself, beyond the basics, then you are going to want to spend some time at the developer center in the next while!</description>

      <description>Like Card, I earn much of my living on intellectual property, and I don&amp;#8217;t buy 90% of the arguments in favor of internet &amp;#8220;music sharing&amp;#8221;. In my view, it&amp;#8217;s theft. If you want to do it anyway, at least be honest about it, rather than trying to tart it up as justice for the &amp;#8220;rapacious&amp;#8221; record companies.

      <description>Kent recently wrote an ASP.NET control (ascx) to display the contents of an RSS feed onto a web page (for use on MSDN) so I decided to slap it on my own web site to display blogs entries at http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/blog/default.aspx{.broken_link}, and I think it looks pretty good!

      <description>If you found a (really) cool download on MSDN, but it was 200+ mb, would you want it packaged for download as a single file, or as multiple .cabs (maybe 10-20 mb each?)
Of course, this isn&amp;#8217;t just hypothetical, but details on what the download is will follow in a few days!
Post comments if you have the time!

Just FYI, disk space is not an issue at all&amp;#8230; it is testing that is the issue, we are going to sign this download and put it up in 2 days&amp;#8230; our test team would need to do another complete test pass on a multi-file download (it is one now) since it truly is different bits&amp;#8230; and we don&amp;#8217;t have enough time for that!</description>

      <description>Was it fate, or mere coincidence?

      <description>We&amp;#8217;ve updated the page with the download URL already (some fast work on the part of our site team there), so you might want to go back and check it out&amp;#8230;
http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/vbrkit/{.broken_link}
If you aren&amp;#8217;t already using some form of download manager, I&amp;#8217;d like to humbly suggest you try out my app from http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/using/columns/code4fun/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun02282003.asp{.broken_link}
It won&amp;#8217;t pull it down amazingly fast (it tries to avoid using up a lot of your CPU and bandwidth if you are using the machine) but it will retry and retry even across restarts&amp;#8230; just fire up the app again to check status.</description>

      <description>I put Chris Sells{.broken_link}&amp;#8216;s most recent article onto the C# home page today, which meant we needed a &amp;#8216;feature&amp;#8217; graphic&amp;#8230; luckily we have another Chris on staff who handles our graphic needs (Chris Mowrer) and he whipped something up.

      <description>I have been drooling over this for that last few weeks&amp;#8230;
 _inner monologue: it doesn&amp;#8217;t do anything that I really need, and if I ever get around to hooking my current music system{.brokenlink} up with something better than S-Video, I could probably replicate its functionality in a pretty short period of time&amp;#8230;.
 but, it sure looks cool, and that has added it to an overly long list of &amp;#8216;things I would buy if I had the $$ to order them and the time to use them&amp;#8217;.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been working on the business and data layers for a web system and, as you might expect, I&amp;#8217;ve been making quite a bit of use of ASP.NET&amp;#8217;s caching system. Now, to test the business layer, I had gone ahead and set up a non-ASP.NET caching system as well using my standard method for caching in Windows applications, a static hashtable with strongly typed string keys (works well, fairly compatible with the ASP.</description>

      <description>I see by Kent&amp;#8217;s latest post that we&amp;#8217;ve gone public with our new aliases.. in the great tradition of Early and Adopter, we have decided we should be known as &amp;#8216;adhoc and random&amp;#8217;. Details won&amp;#8217;t be coming, but let&amp;#8217;s just say that we have a reputation at our workplace as being a bit too quick to write and ship code when we want something done&amp;#8230;
We are working on that problem though&amp;#8230; I think we are scheduled to attend a support group next week, and we aren&amp;#8217;t allowed to code during the meeting&amp;#8230;.</description>

      <description>It has been one of those days&amp;#8230; so much content being worked on, almost none of it visible on MSDN yet&amp;#8230; but it is coming!
If you were watching closely (and I didn&amp;#8217;t expect you to be), you&amp;#8217;ll have noticed some subtle changes on the Dev Centers&amp;#8230; my pic went up onto http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic, I created a new books page at http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/using/books and there are quite a few changes coming for the C# Developer Center as well&amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>Kent used a phrase a few days ago &amp;#8220;loaded for bear&amp;#8221;, and while I can&amp;#8217;t even really explain what it meant (though Google certainly can), it makes me laugh every time I think of it&amp;#8230;
Anyway, I recently bought a home machine (from Dell, because I realized that if I built it myself I would probably spend weeks doing it for 20-30 minutes a night), and I&amp;#8217;ve finally loaded it up with VS.</description>

      <description>The VS team has produced a &amp;#8216;preview&amp;#8217; version of a new plug-in&amp;#8230;
 Setup projects in Visual Studio .NET 2003 can be used to install the .NET Framework with your application, but only if you have installed the optional Visual Studio .NET Framework Bootstrapper Plug-in on your development computer. The Visual Studio .NET Framework Bootstrapper Plug-in modifies the behavior of the Setup project&amp;#8217;s Bootstrapper property to include the .NET Framework bootstrapper as well as the Windows Installer bootstrapper.</description>

Subject: New MSDN TV: Validating Business Rules with XPath Assertions, Pt. 1
After a break, while we updated our media publishing system, MSDN TV is back!
This episode is Pt. 1 of Aaron Skonnard&amp;#8217;s talk at the XML DevCon:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/episode.aspx?xml=episodes/en/20031007XMLAS/manifest.xml
Validating Business Rules with XPath Assertions, Pt. 1
Some XML applications don&amp;#8217;t require validation to function properly but others absolutely require it in one form or another to avoid disasters.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m going to buy an album as download-only today, from www.buymusic.com, and I hope it all works out as good as it sounds (no pun intended!). My biggest worry when downloading music from the various sites is that I won&amp;#8217;t be able to fit the DRM requirements into my digital music lifestyle. I listen to music on my laptop, my home computer, on my music system PC, on my Rio WMA player and sometimes on CDs in the car&amp;#8230; but most of the music sites out there (that I&amp;#8217;ve visited) didn&amp;#8217;t seem to allow all of those uses&amp;#8230; but buymusic.</description>

      <description>I had planned on missing this year&amp;#8217;s PDC, because we had been planning on launching a new application during that same week (one of many!!)&amp;#8230; but now that particular launch has been postponed a bit so I&amp;#8217;m free to attend! That wouldn&amp;#8217;t have made any difference though, since it is sold out (and yes, that applies to us staffers too!), but I&amp;#8217;ve just taken over from another colleague who won&amp;#8217;t be able to attend&amp;#8230; so off I go to buy an overly expensive last minute ticket!</description>

      <description>I am getting really tired of seeing web services (or RSS feeds, or .NET methods, or anything else) with large blocks of complex, structured data that is exposed as &amp;#8220;String&amp;#8221;.
You call the web service, you get back this big string, which you then load into an XMLDocument and off you go (or XPath Navigator, etc&amp;#8230;) &amp;#8230; but if they had just defined the real structure in the first place, I wouldn&amp;#8217;t have to do anything&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;d have a nice &amp;#8220;weather&amp;#8221; structure or &amp;#8220;employee&amp;#8221; object inside an &amp;#8220;employees&amp;#8221; collection&amp;#8230; now, I can certainly massage/convert/deserialize their XML (well, I know it is XML, their wsdl says &amp;#8220;String&amp;#8221;) into a nice object collection, but why should I have to!</description>

A few moments after arriving, and getting hooked up to the Internet&amp;#8230; I put up this letter onto the PDC site, just giving a few helpful bits of info for those of you who arrived late or still haven&amp;#8217;t arrived.

      <description>Well, those demos have certainly floored me&amp;#8230; but I must say I&amp;#8217;m torn.
As a Microsoft guy, I&amp;#8217;m pretty pumped about all of the new stuff&amp;#8230; but as a developer, I have to admit a feeling of sadness seeing all of this cool code (mostly the Avalon and WinFS stuff for me) that I won&amp;#8217;t be able to write into a production app for quite some time.
Duncan&amp;#8217;s big takeaway? I need to bump up the CPU, GPU and memory on my music machine{.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been catching up on a few blogs, now that I&amp;#8217;ve finally managed to get connected 🙂 &amp;#8230;
and I just have one comment (meant in the spirit of helpfulness only) &amp;#8230; It is &amp;#8220;ClickOnce&amp;#8221; not &amp;#8220;OneClick&amp;#8221;
Anyway, check out my article on ClickOnce if you are interested, but watch the name or people might think you are talking about ordering books online&amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>It seems like I just got back from the PDC&amp;#8230; I opened my laptop for the first time today, which isn&amp;#8217;t to say I wasn&amp;#8217;t working&amp;#8230; I have email and access to update the various sites I&amp;#8217;m working on from other machines&amp;#8230; but I certainly wasn&amp;#8217;t coding.

      <description>I had some drinks with Carl Franklin and Mark Dunn at the PDC and discovered that we are all audio freaks&amp;#8230; and while our conversation was focused mostly on mixing boards and real-time noise filtering&amp;#8230; we did talk a bit about their .NET &amp;#8220;radio&amp;#8221; show which is now available on MSDN!
Here is the official blurb and link;

 re: Reading Blogs&amp;#8230; 11/2/2003 9:59 AM Ron Krauter
Hi,
I read your excellent article about ClickOnce on msdn. One of the problems we are having is deploying applications to users machine that have user only access. Unfortunately, the users are not able to install the application as they do not have admin priviledges. We, the admins, end up going to the client machine and installing the application by using &amp;#8220;RUNAS&amp;#8221;.</description>

      <description>Julia appears to have lost something
 I downloaded and installed the VB Language Enhancements for Whidbey White Paper &amp;amp; code from an MSI and cannot freakin&amp;#8217; find it anywhere! 🙂 I had to stop looking after 20 minutes. So hopefully, I&amp;#8217;ll update this post with the location after Duncan or someone can clue me in. I&amp;#8217;m not mad. I think it&amp;#8217;s kind of funny.
 Ok, Ok&amp;#8230; so I built that install file&amp;#8230; so I guess I&amp;#8217;m the one to blame.</description>

      <description>Cory Smith posted about an upcoming session at the Fort Worth .NET Users Group{.broken_link}, G. Andrew Duthie talking about ASP.NET (November 18th)&amp;#8230; this sounds to me like a PDC-quality session, for free and with a lot more time for audience interaction.

If you are in that part of the country, and you are interested in ASP.NET, you should make some time to head on over.
If you are looking for a user group in your own area, check out INETA{.</description>

      <description>I updated a ton of sessions on the PDC site today, many (yep, I&amp;#8217;m being vague&amp;#8230; I don&amp;#8217;t have the details with me at the moment) sessions that didn&amp;#8217;t have slides do now.
You may also notice that the location of the PPT files has changed&amp;#8230; I moved them all to a different location (the download center of Microsoft.com) and I will eventually be pulling down the old ones (that were on a GotDotNet location), so don&amp;#8217;t count on any of the earlier direct file URLs to stay valid.</description>

      <description>Jan Gray talks about the update to the CLR Profiler
We&amp;#8217;ve just updated the CLRProfiler distribution. Once again, we&amp;#8217;re shipping both the source and the prebuilt binaries, and this time we&amp;#8217;re delighted to include a terrific ~100 page tutorial and reference manual written by the tool&amp;#8217;s author, Peter Sollich. I think this new documentation greatly enhances the power and utility of the profiler by demonstrating how to use its features more effectively &amp;#8212; for example, how to diagnose a memory leak.</description>

      <description>Anson Horton gave me this cool .NET component and source code last night so I&amp;#8217;ve uploaded it to microsoft.com for your burning fun
 The XPBurnComponent allows your .NET applications to burn files to CDR/W discs on a Window XP® or Windows 2003 Server system. This component does not work for systems which have a different OS installed; though it will detect that case and give a reasonable error message. This component talks directly to the system’s IMAPI interfaces and doesn’t use the Windows XP CD burning wizard, so it’s possible to create your own snazzy UI for burning CDs.</description>

      <description>Earlier today I posted some background pics&amp;#8230; including some from www.dolomitesworld.com&amp;#8230; Frank Redmond (Content Strategist for .NET Framework) just bust out laughing in my office because he thought I was posting backgrounds based on one of the many wonderful Dolemite films&amp;#8230;
I wasn&amp;#8217;t&amp;#8230; but now Frank is bringing in a selection of movies for me to watch, as it seems that my cultural education is severely lacking in the &amp;#8220;martial arts blaxploitation comedy&amp;#8221; category</description>

      <description>I was playing with the SHAutoComplete API call and the IAutoComplete (2) interface last night (adding auto-complete to an application of mine) and I found a neat article and related component on CodeProject&amp;#8230;
C# does Shell, Part 4 by Arik Poznanski This article is about the AutoComplete features provided by Windows and how to use them with C#. AutoComplete is the ability to expand strings entered into an edit box.</description>

      <description>I recently acquired a digital camera so I started thinking about a photo blog&amp;#8230; something my family out in Winnipeg could subscribe to. A colleague, who has a camera phone, suggested textamerica, which seemed quite happy to accept my registration but I didn&amp;#8217;t go through with the sign up because it seemed that they only intended camera phone users on their site, and I didn&amp;#8217;t want to mess with their system&amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>I just read the description of this game on xbox.com{.broken_link}, which I&amp;#8217;ve done before &amp;#8230; then I read &amp;#8220;Nov 2003&amp;#8221; for a ship date. I swear I actually shivered&amp;#8230; oooh.
Turns out, according to EBGames.com at least, that it is 12/15/2003&amp;#8230; which is the day before I go away from my XBox for 3 weeks&amp;#8230; but I&amp;#8217;m still excited!</description>

      <description>Puppy Luppy just commented:
 Downloaded the SQL Server/Yukon Hands On Labs&amp;#8230;can&amp;#8217;t find anything in the c:\Labs directory&amp;#8230;as in:
C:\Labs\DTS Lab\SourceQuery.sql
C:\Labs\DTS Lab\DTSLabDimProduct.dtsx
 but didn&amp;#8217;t give an email address&amp;#8230; so everyone gets to read my reply 🙂
All of the labs install to your My Documents folder, but most of the lab instructions assume a certain directory (c:\labs for the SQL ones)&amp;#8230; so&amp;#8230; you will either be copying files around a bit, adjusting the instructions or having to run some setup code before you can use the labs.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve received a few emails and blog comments wondering how to submit comments on the MSDN C# Developer Center, suggestions for new comments, etc. so I thought I would quickly mention that anyone who has any comment at all about the site should feel free to email me. There is also a Contact Us link on each page of MSDN if you have any comments that go beyond the C# developer center itself.</description>

 In &amp;#8220;Whidbey&amp;#8221;, the Visual C# language will be extended with a variety of constructs across a broad spectrum of research and industy languages. Learn the ins and outs of how generics provide improved code reuse, iterators simplify implementation of enumerator patterns, anonymous methods ease work with delegates, and partial types provide easier development and code maintenance.</description>

Great&amp;#8230; now I have to dig through it all&amp;#8230; I hate the thought that I&amp;#8217;ve missed out on something neat. 🙂</description>

      <description>The latest &amp;#8216;issue&amp;#8217; of my Coding 4 Fun column has been published to MSDN;
 Duncan Mackenzie describes how to control a serial-port–connected LCD panel using Microsoft Visual Basic .NET and Microsoft Visual C# .NET.
 It is probably worth mentioning that I have hidden a CRC16 class in the code download as well, so even if you aren&amp;#8217;t into hooking up an LCD panel, that CRC stuff might be of use!</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m off in Winnipeg, visiting relatives for Christmas, and I&amp;#8217;ve been experiencing severe bandwidth issues. I brought my laptop along to do some work on my next book, check email and to play movies for my son, but I&amp;#8217;ve barely even had it on. Dial-up isn&amp;#8217;t usually a problem for me, even though I have broadband, I use it in hotels all the time and it works fine for email, etc&amp;#8230;.</description>

Well, it certainly is a lot warmer (just a bit below freezing tonight and up around 44F/7C tomorrow), but there was a lot of ice all over the road and my truck from the freezing rain that had been falling for the last few days.</description>

      <description>I hadn&amp;#8217;t noticed that the graphic classes in .NET had built-in support for animated gifs, but a recent GDN post{.broken_link} shows how you can grab the individual frames out of a GIF and display them one at a time&amp;#8230; I think you would have to find out the intended delay between frames to produce the author&amp;#8217;s desired result, but I&amp;#8217;m not positive as it has been awhile since I made an animated gif 🙂</description>

      <description>I was pretty impressed with the first Roku offering{.broken_link}, a HDTV focused media player that included &amp;#8220;art packs&amp;#8221; to use your HDTV flat panel as artwork&amp;#8230; not that I have one of those flat LCD or Plasma displays&amp;#8230; but the idea was appealing. Now they&amp;#8217;ve come out with the Soundbridge{.broken_link} (a networked audio device) and I&amp;#8217;m impressed again.
Disclaimer: I haven&amp;#8217;t actually seen either of these products, just the specs on the site, but the feature set and design are interesting.</description>

      <description>I was just reading the latest dotnetwire newsletter and this article caught my eye.
 Synchronize Identity Values between Database and DataSet During Updates
After inserting the rows in the database your DataTable does not automatically reflect the identity values of as assigned by the database. The problem can be solved by the clever use of stored procedures and output parameters.
 It gives a very brief description of an important idea, how to return identity values from an insert without having to do another complete select query (even if you batch it together).</description>

      <description>Microsoft Research is a cool place&amp;#8230; and if you had any doubt, you only need to look at some of their publicly exposed data, such as the NETSCAN system. I pulled a description of the system from their site&amp;#8230;
 The Netscan System provides detailed reports on the activity of Usenet newsgroups, the authors who participate in them, and the conversation threads that emerge from their activity. Using the Netscan tool users can get reports about any newsgroup for any day, week, month, quarter, or year, since September 1999.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m sure we all feel that the world needs another RSS Aggregator, and lucky for us&amp;#8230; someone has written one 🙂
 Darshan Singh has created an excellent RSS aggregator using Windows Forms (and C#). RSSConnect supports skinning of the post viewing pane, searching and indexing of posts using the integrated database support as well as a number of other customization points.
Download RSSConnect from PerfectXML.com
 Seriously though, it looks like it has some interesting features around searching/indexing, so I&amp;#8217;m sure it will add to that great pool of desirable aggregator features that all aggregator writers are helping to advance.</description>

 This article identifies the Microsoft .NET Framework version 1.0 or 1.1 APIs that provide similar functionality to Microsoft Win32 functions. One or more relevant .NET Framework APIs are shown for each Win32 function listed. The intended audience for this article is experienced Win32 developers who are creating applications or libraries based on the Microsoft .NET Framework, but anyone looking for a managed counterpart for a Win32 function could find this document useful.</description>

      <description>Every week, Eric Gunnerson, Dan Fernandez and I get together to work on the C# developer center and other C#-ish topics&amp;#8230; and last week we divided up some tasks amongst the three of us. Well, we are meeting again today and I don&amp;#8217;t have those tasks done&amp;#8230; so I&amp;#8217;m starting to watch my back.
I&amp;#8217;m expecting Andy (above) to show up in my office at any moment with the C# &amp;#8216;club of motivation&amp;#8217;, but perhaps I can save myself before he arrives&amp;#8230; with your help.</description>

In a previous entry, I received a comment about how there were no examples of using WebDAV in the Exchange SDK with ASP.Net&amp;#8230; I forwarded it to our SDK team (who can be reached at exsdkfb AT microsoft DOT com) and they pointed out several examples for me:
 Searching Folders (WebDAV) &amp;#8211; C# and VB.Net Sending a Message (WebDAV) &amp;#8211; C# and VB.</description>

      <description>I play Halo for the PC, and every time I get an update I am very excited&amp;#8230; last time it meant a big reduction in the activities of team-killing losers, and I bet it will be equally cool next time. Lots of the applications on my machine have updates available, but unless they check on their own (like Adobe Acrobat, Halo, Messenger, and many others) or they check through Windows Update (like my sound card driver, etc&amp;#8230;), then the odds are I will never install the patch/fix/update.</description>

      <description>What is a Smart Client anyway?
And what makes it so smart?
The term Smart Client was coined to highlight the differences between the typical &amp;#8220;Rich Client&amp;#8221; applications of yesteryear and the next generation of client applications. To understand these differences, and to understand how they are likely to change the face of client-side computing, it is useful to take a trip down memory lane&amp;#8230;

 .NET Html Agility Pack: How to use malformed HTML just like it was well-formed XML&amp;#8230; 
Here is an agile HTML parser that builds a read/write DOM and supports plain XPATH or XSLT. It is an assembly that allows you to parse &amp;#8220;out of the web&amp;#8221; HTML files. The parser is very tolerant with &amp;#8220;real world&amp;#8221; malformed HTML.</description>

      <description>Part 3: Binary Trees and BSTs

This article, the third in a six-part series on data structures in the .NET Framework, looks at a common data structure that is not included in the .NET Framework Base Class Library: binary trees. Whereas arrays arrange data linearly, binary trees can be envisioned as storing data in two dimensions. A special kind of binary tree, called a binary search tree, or BST, allows for a much more optimized search time than with arrays.</description>

      <description>Actually, I&amp;#8217;ve always wanted to mimic something simpler, just the error message and a more button to see the stack trace&amp;#8230; but this component would be wonderful during a beta release, or as something that can be toggled on by the troubleshooting developer&amp;#8230;

      <description>In a recent post to his blog, Paul Vick discusses the new IsNot Operator (and the history/rational behind the Is operator), which allows you to write;
 If myString IsNot Nothing Then  instead of
 If Not myString Is Nothing Then  and then, in another post, he covers the new TryCast operator (which is like C#&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8216;as&amp;#8217; operator), which will allow you to save a bit of extra work (and produce a slight perf improvement in some situations) when checking to see if an object can be cast to a specific type &amp;#8230;.</description>

      <description>Hey folks&amp;#8230;. I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking (dangerous, I know) and I&amp;#8217;ve decided that you need to see more code. This might mean more code in this blog, more on the site, more pointed to that lives on other sites&amp;#8230;. whatever, just more code in the end. I&amp;#8217;m looking for topics though, what do you see as the most common topics that need code snippets? What comes up again and again when you are on the newsgroups and on the web forums out there?</description>

      <description>Someone recently asked me for our template, style guidelines and other details about writing for MSDN. I wanted to find the public page about this, so I dug around for what seemed like ages and couldn&amp;#8217;t find anything even though I knew this was up on MSDN somewhere.
Eventually, I resorted to search and tracked it down at http://msdn.microsoft.com/aboutmsdn/submit.asp. Since it was so hard for me to find, I thought I should bubble it up to the front page of VB and C#, in case anyone else is looking for it 🙂</description>

      <description>Grant{.broken_link} starts on what appears to be a series of posts about a new C# language feature, with &amp;#8220;Anonymous Methods, Part 1 of ?&amp;#8221;{.broken_link}
 So what are anonymous methods? It is a way of writing an unnamed nested method that, just like most languages that have nested methods, allows access to all of the outer method&amp;#8217;s locals and parameters, including the &amp;#8216;this&amp;#8217; parameter.

      <description>Gregg{.broken_link} discusses &amp;#8220;Why interop debugging is difficult{.broken_link}&amp;#8220;&amp;#8230;
 The Visual Studio debugger supports debugging both .NET code and native code at the same time. We call this &amp;lsquo;interop&amp;rsquo;. At first glance, this might not seem like much of an accomplishment. After all, we support debugging .NET code well enough, and we support debugging native code. What&amp;rsquo;s so hard about doing both at the same time?

 Visualizers are custom viewers meant to be used at debug-time. They are entirely managed, and associated with particular types. Where before DataSet was a horrible mess in the watch window, now the standard DataGrid can be used to view the previously inaccessible data contained therein.

      <description>Matt provides us with some insights into the world of language design, a field that most of us have only dabbled in&amp;nbsp;via a university course, with his discussion of keywords, operators and the problems with extending an existing programming language after its original release.
 It amazes me how difficult it is to design new features to a programming language. Once a language is baked in its original form it’s almost impossible to add new semantics let alone syntax rules.</description>

      <description>Gus Perez{.broken_link} has posted the binary and source for a little utlity he has dubbed &amp;#8220;ezClip&amp;#8221;;
 Back in the 7.0 days I wrote a little tool called ezClip. It&amp;#8217;s sole purpose was to allow me to copy/paste files from one command prompt window to another. Our test tree can get pretty deep directory-wise and having to provide full paths to &amp;#8216;copy&amp;#8217; was a pain and instead I often ended up starting up two explorers, one from each window, and then copying via the GUI.</description>

 One of the features that we continually get positive comments on is IntelliSense. More specifically, virtually every user that we talk to likes completion lists. Interestingly, when asked about it most users say that they like IntelliSense because it helps them type.</description>

 In this fifth installment of the article series we&amp;#8217;re going to examine graphs. Graphs are composed of a set of nodes and edges, just like trees, but with graphs there are no rules for the connections between nodes. With graphs, there is no concept of a root node, nor is there a concept of parents and children. Rather, a graph is a collection of interconnected nodes.</description>

      <description>A few team members have blogged about this already, but here I go again&amp;#8230;
 Unit testing is a method of testing individual software components. Each function in every class is tested to make sure it does its job correctly, with the hope that if everything works correctly by itself, higher level problems will be less common or much easier to debug. Wondering if it is right for you? Already doing it, but looking for best practices?</description>

Well, there are a lot of things I&amp;#8217;ve been hoping to add to the Windows Forms Data Grid, and while I&amp;#8217;ve done quite a few of them (3 or 4 custom column types) I&amp;#8217;ve never gotten around to adding the really cool stuff&amp;#8230;.</description>

      <description>Over in the Office side of the world, a set of 6 labs have been released, focused on learning how to use VB.NET and C# to create Office solutions with Office 2003 and Visual Studio Tools for Office&amp;#8230; cool stuff if Office development is your thing (and it certainly is mine{.broken_link})&amp;#8230;
 Visual Studio Tools for the Microsoft Office System 2003 Training
The training labs in this section step you through the process of creating and working with Microsoft&amp;reg; Office Word 2003 and Microsoft Office Excel 2003 solutions using Microsoft Visual Studio&amp;reg; Tools for the Microsoft Office System.</description>

      <description>CodeSmith 2.5{.broken_link} is available, and although I&amp;#8217;ve mentioned it in a few articles on MSDN already, I have to tell you again&amp;#8230; I use this utility all the time.
It is fairly obvious, if you look at the code from any one of my articles, that I use Code Smith to generate my strongly typed collections in almost every single project. What isn&amp;#8217;t obvious is how often I use it in my own projects that never get published (internal to Microsoft, or for myself)&amp;#8230; it is invaluable and I&amp;#8217;ve never even created my own templates.</description>

 Who does Microsoft talk to when they have questions?

      <description>One of the changes from VB6 to VB.NET was the removal of non-zero lower bounded arrays&amp;#8230; a concept discussed by Eric Gunnerson recently, and now covered by Paul&amp;#8230; giving it a bit of VB perspective.
 Non-zero lower bounded arrays (the other side of the coin)
&amp;#8230; To finesse this issue, the CLR designers came up with a compromise: there would be two kinds of arrays in the CLR. One kind, which I&amp;#8217;ll call &amp;#8220;arrays,&amp;#8221; were just like normal VB arrays &amp;#8211; they could have non-zero lower bounds.</description>

      <description>Someone suggested to me that VB.NET Whidbey didn&amp;#8217;t have support for &amp;#8216;Generic Methods&amp;#8217;, so I quickly wrote a bit of sample code to check (yes, it does support Generic Methods) and I thought I&amp;#8217;d post that test code for your amusement.

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking a bit about Generics lately, with the growing conclusion that I will mostly use the ones that ship in the 2.0 version of the .NET Framework, but wrapping my head around a few situations where I could see myself defining Generic classes of my own. With all of these Generics thoughts in my head, I went back and re-read this blog entry from 2/10/2004 by Rick Spencer, and I really found it useful.</description>

      <description>Hey folks, I&amp;#8217;ve been working with the C# Team and two great C# MVPs (Jon Skeet and Nicholas Paldino) to put together a &amp;#8216;live&amp;#8217; C# FAQ. This FAQ is being run as a blog, hosted at http://blogs.msdn.com/csharpfaq and is displayed on the C# Developer Center on MSDN (at http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/team/faq).
This list of questions and answers is continually being updated, so if you don&amp;#8217;t see an answer to your question, and you think it is a common one&amp;#8230; please submit it through the &amp;#8220;Ask a FAQ Question&amp;#8221; area of the blog.</description>

      <description>Eric Gunnerson has posted some information regarding upcoming C# language changes, definitely worth a read;
 Customer Focused Design
Since February 1st, I&amp;#8217;ve been getting a ton of negative feedback about the C# language, and two weeks ago we were notified that the FCLC was shopping a proposed rule, so we&amp;#8217;ve been talking about the issue in our design meetings. It&amp;#8217;s been a very contentious discussion, but we have reached an agreement, and since this is going to show up in the next Whidbey partner drop, I&amp;#8217;ve decided to talk about it here&amp;#8230;.</description>

Let&amp;#8217;s start by talking about Rename.&amp;nbsp;I view Rename as being one of the “Tier 1” refactorings – the refactoring we absolutely must provide, and which must be of the highest quality. They must be fast, reliable, and easy to use.</description>

      <description>I have to admit that I haven&amp;#8217;t developed a &amp;#8220;wizard&amp;#8221; framework yet in .NET, I&amp;#8217;ve just been stacking panels on top of each other, naming them step1&amp;#8230;stepN and then showing and hiding them as necessary. Not exactly an easy-to-reuse approach, but it works. Justin Rogers{.broken_link}, a developer who has worked on the GDN Workspaces system, the ASP.NET forums, Terrarium and more&amp;#8230; has released an article on his blog that details a structured approach to create a Windows Forms Wizard:</description>

      <description>Not a long post (I&amp;#8217;ve included it all below), but useful nonetheless
 
C# Featurette #2 &amp;#8211; Inline Warning Control   Another feature that we added for Whidbey is the ability to selectively disable warnings within your code. For example: #pragma warning disable 135 &amp;nbsp; // Disable warning CS135 in this block
 #pragma warning restore 135  Comments on this feature? Click on the &amp;#8220;Featurette&amp;#8221; link above and tell Eric what you think!</description>

      <description>Eric describes a new Whidbey feature focused on&amp;nbsp;creating those &amp;#8216;utility&amp;#8217; classes in the style of System.Math or System.Environment:
 C# Whidbey Featurette #3: Static classes 
 Because all functions in C# must live inside of a class, there are some clases &amp;#8211; System.Math is a canonical example &amp;#8211; that are merely collections of static methods. Since it&amp;#8217;s useless to create an instance of such a class, in current versions of C#, you can protect against this by creating a private constructor.</description>

      <description>In a very &amp;#8216;Easter-Egg-ish&amp;#8217; post, Grant Richins{.broken_link} (a developer on the C# Compiler Team), explains a configuration option of &amp;#8216;alink.dll&amp;#8217;.
 So everybody hopefully knows you can put a star &amp;#8220;*&amp;#8221; for either of the last 2 version numbers of the AssemblyVersion attribute.&amp;nbsp; ALink will then translate that into the days and minutes since January 1st, 2000.&amp;nbsp; Well, here comes the feature: What if you don&amp;#8217;t like January 1st 2000?&amp;nbsp; Well, you can change it.</description>

      <description>Scott, one of my colleagues from my first year at MSDN, has a blog now{.broken_link} and he just posted a cool entry illustrating the new configuration system in VS 2005&amp;#8230;
 Configuration is a breeze.   In the current Visual Studio .NET 2005, you’re going to find that a great thing has happened to configuration. Basically, the mechanism for creating, editing, and parsing configuration sections just got really easy. If this particular item snags a bit of interest, I’ll go as deep as I can in future posts.</description>

I&amp;#8217;m not sure how you feel about that, but I craved a BulletList control for a while. Then, I made the decision to build it myself. Quite surprisingly, it wasn&amp;#8217;t too difficult &amp;#8230;  Dino describes the creation of 5 ASP.</description>

      <description>With code samples and screenshots based on the recent Community drop of Whidbey (VS 2005), Scott{.broken_link} explains how to create your first debugger visualizer:
 Debugger Visualizers on VS 2005 Community Tech Preview  &amp;#8230; Visualizers allow for advanced, customized viewing of data while debugging. Today&amp;#8217;s data windows have their limitations; text-only, hierarchical, spatially constrained &amp;#8211; not the best for viewing an image, for example. Visualizers allow you to create completely custom views using WinForms to best show the data within any managed object.</description>

      <description>In many ways, I&amp;#8217;m ok with that; it isn&amp;#8217;t like they took away the book when they made the movie&amp;#8230;
LOTR is one of the few exceptions in recent times, although I also enjoyed Timeline (forgive me)&amp;#8230; Bourne Identity might have been a good movie, I can&amp;#8217;t say&amp;nbsp;because having read the book coloured my view of it too much to handle the changes&amp;#8230; I could go on, listing off a variety of movies where I loved the book but found the movie lacking, but that isn&amp;#8217;t the point of this post.</description>

      <description>Two video interviews with Eric Gunnerson appeared on Channel 9 today:
 What has the biggest change at Microsoft since you&amp;#8217;ve been here? How do you design new features for C#?  &amp;nbsp;</description>

      <description>This new feature, which isn&amp;#8217;t limited to Windows Forms, allows a single class to extend across multiple files, isn&amp;#8217;t limited to Windows Forms but the designer-generated code is just screaming out for a solution like this.
Jay writes:
 
Winforms designed code and C# partial classes 
 In Whidbey, the WinForms designer takes advantage of a new C# language feature called “
partial classes

”.&amp;nbsp; This allows them to pull out the designer generated code into a separate file.</description>

      <description>Very cool article from Code Project; this is something I have wanted for awhile&amp;#8230;.. from the moment we started outputing RSS from MSDN, it seemed to me that you&amp;#8217;d want to view them inside of VS&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;m downloading this right to try it out, but the article is well written and covers a lot of good topics (like Isolated Storage, async delegates and more), so I&amp;#8217;m pretty confident the add-in will work well 🙂</description>

      <description>This time, he wants to know what you think about C#&amp;#8217;s community:
 C# Community Review

&amp;#8230; If a friend came up to you and said, “I&amp;#8217;m thinking of using C#, but I&amp;#8217;m concerned that there isn&amp;#8217;t a good community around it”, what would you say? What are the good things about the C# community? What are the bad things? If you wanted us to change one thing, what would it be?</description>

      <description>Joe Mayo posted a great &amp;#8216;frequently asked question&amp;#8217; along with a very clear answer, to the C# FAQ recently&amp;#8230;.
 Why did I receive the error: &amp;#8220;The type or namespace &amp;#8216;&amp;#8217; does not exist in the class or namespace &amp;#8216;&amp;#8217; (are you missing an assembly reference?)&amp;#8221; 
 If you haven&amp;#8217;t found the FAQ yet, check it out&amp;#8230;. submit your questions (please try to stick to common C# issues, not general support questions, as we are trying to only answer questions that would make good additions to the FAQ list) and comment on existing ones!</description>

      <description>I heard this was coming in a few weeks, but it is here now{.broken_link}&amp;#8230;.
This is a free download, but note that you have to have your original CD-Key for this to work&amp;#8230;. and that the version that supports custom maps is multi-player only and doesn&amp;#8217;t ship with any of the original maps&amp;#8230; the dedicated server program is included though!!
&amp;nbsp;
[Update: Note sure about that &amp;#8216;doesn&amp;#8217;t ship with maps&amp;#8217; comment I made&amp;#8230; I read that in an article on the web, but the maps appeared to be there when I played&amp;#8230; perhaps the new maps added in Halo PC are missing&amp;#8230; but I can&amp;#8217;t be sure]</description>

      <description>Back in highschool, I cut lawns for a lot of people&amp;#8230;. so many that it was really a summer job and kept me quite busy, and then in University I took a job laying sod for a landscape company&amp;#8230;. kinda went from the amateur level to the professional there. Both jobs were hot, dirty and left me ready for nothing but sleep at the end of a day&amp;#8230; but I&amp;#8217;ve often remarked to my wife that sometimes I long for that type of job.</description>

      <description>Giving us an early peek at his TechEd 2004 talk, Eric discusses how to handle enums in your code,&amp;nbsp;since they are not constrained to the list of options you define in the enum and also because they can change in ways that could break your code in the future&amp;#8230;
 
Enums and validation

&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8230; So, my first point is that enums are not sets &amp;#8211; they can take on any value from the underlying type.</description>

      <description>I answer quite a few questions on the forums on GotDotNet{.broken_link}, and sometimes those answers are interesting enough (in my opinion) to be exposed to a larger audience&amp;#8230;. Coding this particular one{.broken_link} caused Brian Johnson{.broken_link} to say&amp;#8230; &amp;#8220;cool&amp;#8221;, so it seems worth posting about here 🙂
The question was (paraphrased) &amp;#8220;How do I stop AutoRun from happening while my app is running and the user puts in a CD?&amp;#8221;, and the answer is that if your app is the active application, then you can listen for and respond to a certain Windows Message (QueryCancelAutoPlay) and choose to cancel the AutoRun/AutoPlay action for that particular moment (the next CD inserted will result in the message being sent again, and your code gets to choose once again whether or not to cancel the event).</description>

 Just a little note: If you experience problems watching these videos, you may wish to try installing the WMP9 codecs (or WMP9 itself, although that is not a requirement) or following the steps in this KB article.</description>

Headed over to registration today, very very busy&amp;#8230; then to the Cabana with Erik Porter&amp;#8230; very very empty&amp;#8230;. Erik and I then decided to head off to catch a pre-conference session, but even those were backed up due to the long registration lines. Oh well, back to the Cabana to wait for some great VB questions 🙂</description>

 TryIIS.com is a new site dedicated to resources for evaluating IIS, and contains over 100 whitepapers and other materials&amp;#8230;
 Now, I have no idea why they had to create a special site for this, when they have an IIS section of microsoft.</description>

      <description>Paul Vick, language guy for Visual Basic and unofficial spokesman for Krispy Kreme (look at the picture to understand that comment), arrived yesterday at TechEd&amp;#8230;. Look for him around the Developer Division Cabanas (5 and 6), the Visual Studio 2005 booth and at the &amp;#8220;Meet the VB Team&amp;#8221; session (Thursday 3:15-4:30).

      <description>Returning to the room tonight I was greeted by an amazing spread of technology across the bed in my hotel room. Early in the day I had returned to my room only to realize that my cell phone was not in my pocket as expected, so I had proceeded to pull everything out of my backpack, one item at a time, and place it on the bed. Turns out it wasn&amp;#8217;t in there, it was back in the Cabana&amp;#8230; but that isn&amp;#8217;t really the point of this post.</description>

      <description>Cyrus, recent addition to the C# bloggers list and poster of many posts, has been blogging extensively from TechEd&amp;#8230;
 OMGTHXURGR8!!!!
That&amp;#8217;s basically the message we got today concerning the work we&amp;#8217;re doing in the C# IDE for VS 2005. I ended up not being able to show people the new stuff on a person by person basis because we ended up getting too much of a backlog of people while that was happening.</description>

      <description>I get this question a lot, and I explain many of the same things that Paul goes through in this post, so I&amp;#8217;d love it if more people would read this material:
The &amp;#8220;native&amp;#8221; .NET language? In the comments on my post on language choice, Patrick asked “isn&amp;#8217;t C# the language that&amp;#8217;s most &amp;#8216;native&amp;#8217; to the .NET environment?” Christopher then follows up with&amp;nbsp;a related question as to whether developers should use functions in the&amp;nbsp;System namespace instead of ones in the Microsoft.</description>

A while ago Eric asked “Who are the best C# bloggers external to MS?” which sparked a similar question in my own mind: Who are the best VB bloggers external to MS? I have my own opinions, but I&amp;#8217;m interested to see who people find helpful and/or interesting. Just add your comments and I&amp;#8217;ll post a list later this months&amp;#8230;

The Truth about Nullable Types and VB&amp;#8230;

      <description>For most folks working with ASP.NET, this should be taken as essential information&amp;#8230; Don&amp;#8217;t let the Whidbey reference in the first paragraph fool you, by the way, this post describes how to accomplish debugging as a non-admin in Visual Studio .NET 2003.  Debugging an ASP.NET application as a non-admin The debugger team has gotten many requests to debug ASP.NET applications as a non-admin. In Whidbey, the ASP.NET team did a good job solving this problem.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been using unpublished posts as a way to create planned blog posts for later&amp;#8230; then, when I have a chance I go back and finish them up and mark them as &amp;#8216;Published&amp;#8217;&amp;#8230; but I just noticed that when I do that, the published date is the date on which I originally created the unpublished post. I can certainly understand why that is, but I&amp;#8217;m curious as what everyone else expects?</description>

      <description>As other people have probably mentioned here and there, there is a very nice&amp;nbsp;health club&amp;nbsp;near Microsoft and a membership to that club is one of the options in our benefits plan. Therefore, it isn&amp;#8217;t all that surprising that most of the folks&amp;nbsp;in the gym at any particular time are Microsoft employees. This can lead to an interesting occurance that has left me wondering (on more than one&amp;nbsp;occasion), what is the &amp;#8216;right&amp;#8217; thing to do in this situation?</description>

A conversion from integer to long form english&amp;#8230; I could write that 😉 
 
[Editorial note: A more complete sample is available through article:

  I find little conversion functions to be the most interesting type of programming you can spend your time on.&amp;nbsp; You wind up exercising so many areas of programming expertise to make the algorithms short, complete, bug free, and as fast as possible&amp;#8230;.</description>

      <description>Then, first let me say you have my pity, and then let me direct you to this nice piece by my old business partner (we started our first consulting business together out of our house)&amp;#8230; &amp;nbsp;
 
Responding to RFP&amp;#8217;s

Many of you who are also consultants know that one of the realities of life is to write sales proposals.&amp;nbsp; When working for large companies or governments you typically submit a proposal in response to a RFP – a request for proposal.</description>

      <description>As with my earlier messing around with a poll, I took a concept from the www.asp.net site today and made my own &amp;#8220;CheckDotNet.aspx&amp;#8221; page. The one on www.asp.net only checks for the .NET Framework 1.0 or better, so I modified the logic to detect 1.1 and 1.0 as two distinct cases&amp;#8230; recommending an upgrade for no framework or 1.0, and returning &amp;#8220;Framework Found&amp;#8221; if you have 1.1 already.

      <description>Scott Watermasysk blogs about the new &amp;#8216;Using&amp;#8217; statement in VB.NET 2005&amp;#8230;
 Using in VB.NET
I have not touched VB.NET since early in .NET Beta 1, so I am a bit rusty. One thing I was happy to find is support for using statements in VB.NET 2005. It took me a try or two to figure out the syntax, so I figured I would post it here for future reference.</description>

      <description>When I started out to build a voting control, I drew up a set of requirements that led to a 5+ table system&amp;#8230; some form of UI for creating/editing polls&amp;#8230; plus the control itself. Then, when I had SQL running behind my web site, I wanted something up fast&amp;#8230;. so I just grabbed a simple voting control from www.asp.net (by Rob Howard). The simplicity of this control (and its database structure) is a big plus, especially for me &amp;#8230; it is a great place to start to play around with ASP.</description>

Visual C# 2003 &amp;#8220;Implement Interface&amp;#8221; feature

Just discovered a great tip for Visual&amp;nbsp;C# 2003.
  If&amp;nbsp;you implement an interface (or event/delegate) on your class and don&amp;#8217;t want&amp;nbsp;to type all the methods, just type the interface name&amp;nbsp;in your class derivation list and Intellisense will display a tooltip saying “Press TAB to insert stubs for ”. Pressing &amp;#8216;TAB&amp;#8217; will insert stub method implemenations into your class.</description>

      <description>Debugger Window Menu Items: Where should they be?

The VS debugger since 7.0 has put most debugger windows on the Debug menu, under the Windows sub-menu. I say &amp;#8216;most&amp;#8217; because the Output window lives on the View menu, under Other Windows sub-menu.  Where do you expect debugger windows to be on the menu? (Ignore Output for now, we intend to fix that one independent of this). Your choices are:   Where they have been since 7.</description>

Tonight my wife and I went out to a Jewel Concert{.broken_link}, which was great&amp;#8230; although our position on the grass gave us a better view of one of the main support poles on the stage than of Jewel herself&amp;#8230; and at the end of the show, we picked up our &amp;#8220;Instant Live&amp;#8221; CD of the concert (yes, the concert that had just ended).</description>

      <description>As a big fan of components, my applications are often composed of many different assemblies&amp;#8230; essentially I break out anything that seems &amp;#8216;ready to reuse&amp;#8217;&amp;#8230; but perhaps I should reconsider?
 Grouping classes in an assembly{#_7edcfc09107_HomePageDays_DaysListctl1_DayItem_DayListctl0_TitleUrl}
This useful bit of information crossed my desk today:
When it comes to packaging in separate assemblies, remember that you pay a fairly large performance hit on an assembly load. An assembly should really be considered a unit of security control, independent versioning, or contribution from disparate sources.</description>

      <description>I installed MCE{.broken_link} onto my main home computer recently, which happens to have a modem that supports caller id&amp;#8230;. and I was just sitting in front of it tonight watching a recorded episode of “The Dead Zone” when someone called&amp;#8230; a nice transparent message floated up telling me their name and #&amp;#8230;. and when someone else answered the phone, it just faded away&amp;#8230;

Operator Overloading In Visual Basic 2005

Operator Overloading, new to Visual Basic 2005, simplifies the use and development of complex types by allowing you to specify your own implementation for standard operations such as addition and subtraction.  </description>

      <description>I had been planning to go to Spiderman 2 last night at 12:01 am&amp;#8230; but I decided to skip it instead&amp;#8230; so I went out during the day and spent my Father&amp;#8217;s Day gift (a gift certificate for Best Buy&amp;#8230; my wife made a great choice) on a wireless xbox controller{.broken_link} from Logitech and the new Spiderman 2 game{.broken_link}.
Now, I loved the first game&amp;#8230; so my opinion should be considered in that light, but I really enjoyed playing this game.</description>

      <description>Luke, a PM on the C# IDE team has started a blog&amp;#8230; should be a good source of info, especially around the new Express Edition.
 Intro + C# Express &amp;#8230; The project that I’ve been working on for most of my time at Microsoft is the Visual C# Express Edition.&amp;nbsp; So as you can probably guess, I’m really excited that the betas of the Express editions are now available for download.</description>

      <description>Chats on Visual Basic 2005


For the past year, I&amp;#8217;ve been organizing the Visual Basic chats that appear at 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/chats/

. For the most part, these chats focused on answering your questions about Visual Basic.  Naturally, now that the Beta 1 for Visual Basic 2005 is available, I wanted to schedule some chats to answer your Beta questions. But after discussing this with Robert Green, we decided to change the format somewhat; instead of just answering questions, the chat hosts will also be looking for feedback about what you like (or don&amp;#8217;t like) about the selected feature&amp;#8230;.</description>

      <description>One of the big reasons I redesigned the poll component{.broken_link}, was so that I could track votes over time&amp;#8230; I did this by adding a &amp;#8216;dateVoted&amp;#8217; column to my vote table, and then using an “On Insert” trigger to set that column to the current date/time&amp;#8230;. peachy keen, except when I exported the tables and stored procs to my live SQL box, I forgot to include my triggers&amp;#8230; so all the votes on my previous poll have no date/time info.</description>

      <description>In an earlier post{.broken_link}, I mentioned that I use a trigger to update a &amp;#8220;DateCreated&amp;#8221; field in one of my tables&amp;#8230; and various people commented on this&amp;#8230; asking &amp;#8220;why not pass in a value in your Insert?&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;why not use a default value?&amp;#8221;
Since I feel that replying to comments in the comments section is generally just a black hole, I thought I&amp;#8217;d raise this discussion up to a proper blog entry of its own 🙂</description>

 .NET: Printer Margin Bounds in .NET    There&amp;#8217;s a very good Code Project article by Philippe Leybaert on getting the appropriate printer margin bounds so that what you print from you WinForms application will appear correctly. &amp;nbsp; While PrintPageEventArgs has a property MarginBounds, this property doesn&amp;#8217;t account for the hard margins of your printer for left and right margins &amp;#8212; although they do appear to have the top and bottom margins right.</description>

      <description>I noticed yesterday that my poll wasn&amp;#8217;t showing the question on the top of the list of choices, or the list of results. Viewing the source made it pretty obvious the asp:label was rendering, but that it was empty. Checking my code everything seemed fine, but when I retrieved the poll details through a Stored Proc I was using an Output param for the question text and it was always blank.</description>

 Do you run a personal site? Do you have any form of authentication? What do you use to handle it (I&amp;#8217;m planning Forms Authentication against SQL Server)? What do you use it for?</description>

When viewed through the IFRAME IE&amp;#8217;s default settings (well, my settings&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;m not sure if they are the default) blocked any cookies from that page, which meant that you could vote as often as you liked&amp;#8230; hmm&amp;#8230; not a good thing.</description>

Something more extreme, like rejecting any second vote from the same IP seems wrong, since multiple people could be coming in through the same IP.. in fact, you have to assume that is likely over time&amp;#8230;</description>

I added a little blurb at the top asking folks to send in any ideas they have for this page, please use it&amp;#8230; I try to scan the community sites regularly but I&amp;#8217;m certainly missing a lot of stuff.
If you see something worth noting on the VB site, let me know.</description>

      <description>Blurb copied using the cool &amp;#8220;Blog This&amp;#8221; link on the ondotnet pages 🙂
 Rapid Application Development with VB.NET 2.0 by Jesse Liberty &amp;#8212; For a couple of years now, Jesse Liberty been touting the Microsoft endorsed-sentiment that it really doesn&amp;#8217;t matter if you program in C# or in VB.NET, since both are just syntactic sugar layered on top of MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language, the true language of .NET). That appears to be changing a bit with Whidbey.</description>

If it was, I can continue to do that with my articles &amp;#8230; basically posting my version of them up in advance onto www.duncanmackenzie.net and then redirecting that to the real article once it ends up on MSDN.</description>

      <description>The age-old question of &amp;#8216;how do I avoid putting funky Office HTML into my blog postings&amp;#8217; came up on an internal email list today, and one of the answers was a pointer to http://stevemiller.net/PureText/, which I had never heard of&amp;#8230; but it looks cool!
 &amp;#8220;Have you ever copied some text from a web page, a word document, help, etc., and wanted to paste it as simple text into another application without getting all the formatting from the original source?</description>

 .Text Threading Bug

I mean, Longhorn seems cool and all&amp;#8230; but I just wasn&amp;#8217;t all that interested in a UI technology that wouldn&amp;#8217;t run on anything but the very latest OS, especially considering the very wide deployment of XP that will exist by the time Longhorn ships.</description>

      <description>Ok, so here&amp;#8217;s the scoop&amp;#8230; Robert Green, the Visual Basic PM focused on Community, is going to be in charge of the /community portion of the VB developer center on MSDN from now on&amp;#8230; updating it, designing it, blogging about it, etc&amp;#8230;.
What does this mean?
Well, for one thing it means a big change in content today, but it also means much more frequent updates and a ton of VB community information available from one place.</description>

      <description>Ok, so any action you take against your database is your own responsibility&amp;#8230; so this is my fault, but I&amp;#8217;m still miffed.
I installed the new drop of the Forums code from Rob Howard and co&amp;#8230; and one of the various bits of information I picked up from the support forum and the docs was that I could happily install this onto an existing database because (quoting from the readme here)&amp;#8230; &amp;#8220;All the objects in the Forums product use the forums_ prefix so there shouldn&amp;#8217;t be any problem&amp;#8221; .</description>

 My web host, easerve, contacted me and let me know they had daily backups of my data available&amp;#8230; and once I told them the date/time at which I blew away my data, they&amp;#8217;d provide the appropriate backup file&amp;#8230; (which they did, and I&amp;#8217;m rocking along now with my old data back&amp;#8230;) &amp;#8230; yet another great bit of customer service from easerve&amp;#8230;  Rob Howard and Jason Alexander, both from telligent responded with both &amp;#8216;sorry&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;we&amp;#8217;ll fix our scripts&amp;#8217;&amp;#8230; a very quick response considering I didn&amp;#8217;t even email them about it&amp;#8230;   Overall, my annoying little incident resulted in a great response from two different groups&amp;#8230; very nice.</description>

      <description>I created a Pocket PC remote for Windows Media Player, but I only had speakers right next to the music system&amp;#8230; so the remote wasn&amp;#8217;t all that useful&amp;#8230; but I just picked up this wireless speaker;
 
 and suddenly it is time to install that software again &amp;#8230; my wife now puts the speaker wherever she is during the day, but having to go into my office and login to change the music is a small annoyance, so I hope the visual remote helps make it easier.</description>

      <description>Anytime people talk about developing shareware with .NET, the discussion centers around the download/install of the Framework, because that is the issue that seems like the biggest hurdle to non-corporate developers&amp;#8230; I could go on and on about the various methods of getting the Framework installed in 1.1 and in 2.0, but I like what Nick posted to the forum;
 &amp;#8230;your audience will judge your app based only on the advantages it offers, its price, ease of use and generally things that are used as criteria for every other app, .</description>

      <description>Shawn, my boss, recommends this AW book by Rebecca Riordan, which is one of the few .NET books I&amp;#8217;ve found time to read lately, and I have to agree&amp;#8230; I have doubts on whether or not it will sell as many copies as it should, as people seem to cluster around very focused books even when this book is exactly what they need, but it certainly deserves to be successful.</description>

      <description>I was staring at my bandwidth usage tonight and it is quite high&amp;#8230;. and thanks to this cool SVG based stats system that easerve provides, I can drill down and figure out which pages are causing the bulk of that traffic&amp;#8230; well, the biggest offenders for # of hits were the aggBugs that .Text includes (because my blog posts, including the aggbugs, are shown on MSDN, and therefore generate 3 aggBug requests for every single view of the Visual Basic or C# Developer Center pages), but the biggest use of bandwidth was by far the mainfeed.</description>

Seriously, almost every post includes a code or XML sample of some sort&amp;#8230; that is a high signal-to-noise ratio folks&amp;#8230; all on fairly interesting .NET topics, including quite a few discussions of FxCop&amp;#8230; you should definitely check this blog out (link below)&amp;#8230;.</description>

 Command line compile Windows vb app
I need to have someone show me how to compile via command line a vb.net windows app. Could someone show me the minimum code to get a window/form up with maybe a label or button on it.
 so I posted up a sample to the samples page on my personal site that shows creating two programs via the VB.</description>

      <description>My Advanced Basics column from the October 2004 issue is now up online&amp;#8230;
 Building a Progress Bar that Doesn&amp;#8217;t Progress
 and if you think that title is odd, here is what Chris Sells had to say when he first heard it&amp;#8230; (comments used 100% without permission, but I figure he won&amp;#8217;t mind)&amp;#8230;
 &amp;#8220;I can’t wait to read &amp;#8216;Building a Progress Bar that Doesn&amp;#8217;t Progress.&amp;#8217; I assume follow on articles will cover &amp;#8216;Building a Button that Doesn&amp;#8217;t Butt&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;Building a Status Bar that Doesn&amp;#8217;t Stat?</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve recently signed up for NetFlix, but earlier I had tried out GameFly, a service I like to think of as &amp;#8220;NetFlix for Games&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230; and I remembered that I had planned to describe my experience on my blog at some point, but I had never gotten around to it!
Basically Gamefly is the same deal as NetFlix. You fill up a queue with games you want, they send you the first 3, then send you the next whenever you return one of the ones you have.</description>

      <description>As part of the United Way&amp;#8217;s Day of Caring, I went into Seattle today and did some work for a non-profit counseling center&amp;#8230; specifically creating an Access system for them&amp;#8230;. a few tables, 3 forms, and a bunch of analysis queries and reports all around stats&amp;#8230;
Great stuff&amp;#8230;. helping out a non-profit, but it was my first time building anything in Access in ages&amp;#8230;. I used to do it all the time as part of past jobs, etc&amp;#8230;.</description>

      <description>I took Scott Watermasysk&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8216;book control&amp;#8217; and modified it recently to display more than one book (moving it to VB.NET along the way), and I reduced the file it pulls from down to just a list of ISBN #s&amp;#8230;. but then I wasn&amp;#8217;t able to display the title of the book as a tooltip (like the original does)&amp;#8230; so I signed up for Amazon&amp;#8217;s web services and added some code to pull the book&amp;#8217;s info through the web services and cache it for use in the control.</description>

 Connor&amp;#8217;s feeling pretty sick today. He still has a fever. We&amp;#8217;re definitely not going to preschool. I explained to him that the cold is a &amp;#8220;bad guy&amp;#8221;, and that he has good guys in his body that are fighting him.</description>

      <description>Had an interesting coffee with Serge Baranovsky,founder of vbCity.com and owner of a cool license plate:
We discussed a variety of topics, including the idea of adding a &amp;#8216;user submitted links&amp;#8217; section to MSDN that functions somewhat like what http://www.asp.net has on the home page (a list of resources that have been submitted by anyone who cares to do so, and then approved by a small body of insiders). What do you think of this idea?</description>

 What type of database do you use for the majority of your applications?

      <description>&amp;#8230; and it is almost ready to ship&amp;#8230;.
The new system will result in a few changes to the MSDN feeds, the most notable of which is that our feeds will no longer reflect a certain time span (they currently contain all of the appropiately attributed items from the past 30 days), but will instead contain a certain # of items. They also have a bit more data in them, including the author of the article (in the dc:creator element) and a collection of category elements containing all of the attribution that we have applied to that article in our back end system.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m working on the bootstrapper chapter for my upcoming ClickOnce book and it occured to me that a lot of people probably haven&amp;#8217;t heard about the bootstrapper for Visual Studio .NET 2003&amp;#8230;
 Visual Studio .NET Framework Bootstrapper Plug-in
The Visual Studio .NET Framework Bootstrapper Plug-in modifies the behavior of the Setup project&amp;#8217;s Bootstrapper property to include the .NET Framework bootstrapper as well as the Windows Installer bootstrapper.

      <description>Yesterday I started up my first Fable game, 3 hours of my life lost already. Lots of fun though.
Tonight wasn&amp;#8217;t as much fun; I tried 3 times to play and each time I was stopped with a dirty disc error&amp;#8230; not sure why that is, but after 3 times I figured it was a divine hint to get back to work 🙂</description>

      <description>Robert Green and I are planning a series of articles focused around Visual Basic 2005 Express Edition&amp;#8230; quick articles, not a lot of text, but with enough code to do something cool and useful&amp;#8230; but we need ideas, and we are looking for submissions of content. If you have some ideas, comment away&amp;#8230; and if you&amp;#8217;d be interested in submitting something, just let me know!
Thanks!</description>

      <description>Mike Dimmick comments on SQL Server&amp;#8217;s licensing policy and compares it to Oracle&amp;#8230; which puzzled me. I&amp;#8217;m no licensing expert, but from my days in MCS I used to read up on Oracle a bit and it seemed to me that they used a similar model to ours in determining per-user licensing costs. So I looked it up.
Oracle&amp;#8217;s per-user pricing is defined as per &amp;#8220;Named User Plus&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230; from their own licensing material ( http://www.</description>

      <description>In an earlier post, I mentioned that I had written a new system for producing MSDN&amp;#8217;s RSS feeds, and those feeds are now live at the same URLs as the previous versions. You might get some duplicates in your aggregators, (since these are new feeds but with some overlap of items from the old feeds) but that should be temporary. Anyway, check them out (here is the one for VB) and let me know what you think.</description>

      <description>This is not about .NET. I just found a site full of information about standard patterns that are being used in user interfaces in both desktop applications and web sites, that I thought you folks might like.
 _There&amp;#8217;s nothing new here.
If you&amp;#8217;ve done any Web or UI design, or even thought about it much, you should say, &amp;#8220;Oh, right, I know what that is&amp;#8221; to most of these patterns.</description>

      <description>(I&amp;#8217;m kidding)
Wikis seem to be nothing but free space for spammers&amp;#8230; yes, yes&amp;#8230; I know.. they have good aspects, but it seems whenever I get a link to a wiki, the odds I&amp;#8217;m going to see what I expected are very low (and the odds of seeing farm animals in disturbing poses is high).
Today I decided to click on a link to see screenshots of GTK#, the UI engine in Mono, and they decided to post these shots onto a Wiki.</description>

Sure&amp;#8230; I think the Whidbey Class Designer rocks. But you don&amp;#8217;t have Whidbey today, so you might be interested in a class building utility like this one from Mod2Software.
Check it out here
 &amp;#8220;This program allows you to build, maintain, and deploy Visual Basic .NET classes quickly and easily, with no fuss. Simply point and click to add class items, tweak their settings, and deploy your class to your project – it&amp;rsquo;s as simple as that!</description>

      <description>Recently I transitioned the C# Content Strategist role over to Frank Redmond, but that was only the first of several changes for me at MSDN. Today, my boss made the rest of the changes public, so now I can talk about it 🙂
I&amp;#8217;m going to be leaving the Content Strategy team completely and joining the development group within MSDN, focusing on the tools and infrastructure that MSDN runs on, instead of the content that it publishes.</description>

      <description>When we originally added RSS feeds to the various developer centers on MSDN, we included a line (shown below) in the HTML of those pages that let browsers and other software know that there was a RSS feed available that was related to the content of the page.
&amp;lt;font face=&amp;quot;&#39;Courier New&#39;,Courier,monospace&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;link rel=&amp;quot;alternate&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;application/rss+xml&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Visual Basic Developer Center&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;rss.xml&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;  Later, quite awhile after that initial launch, someone (ok, it was me) decided to create a set of page templates for all of the pages in use in the Developer Centers, and when they did that work, they inadvertently removed this line of HTML from the Developer Center home pages.</description>

      <description>I stopped at Starbucks in Redmond today on my way into work, and the drive thru was really backed up so I decided to run inside. Well, that was lucky for me because I got to see and play with the latest expansion to their service offerings, the ability to pick songs and burn them onto CD right there in the store. I picked out a few (7) songs and a few minutes later I had my very own little compilation complete with a color picture on the CD itself (chosen by me, for a list of images) a case and a custom printed liner with the picture that I chose for the CD.</description>

      <description>I have been pondering the best approach for ensuring user supplied HTML is XHTML&amp;#8230; and while it actually isn&amp;#8217;t hard to validate whether or not a given block of HTML is valid XHTML, what I really wanted was something that would fix up some of the more basic errors. Well, MSDN Magazine to the rescue&amp;#8230;

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been rebuilding my site to use master pages (which is done and works great!) and along the way I decide to get rid of the tables used to create my top and side menu areas, moving instead to a CSS model&amp;#8230;
No idea why, but I can&amp;#8217;t get it to do what I want!! I&amp;#8217;ve created a CSS based right off of a sample that is baked into Dreamweaver, and then tried to wrap the right styles around my content, but the main area of my page is appearing below the side menu, not floating alongside&amp;#8230; bah.</description>

      <description>I love the internet for one main reason&amp;#8230;. porn. Or is the fact that everyone is willing to help you when you have a problem?
Oh yeah, it is that second one.
I posted recently about my frustrating experiences with trying to create a CSS based site layout for my site, and a bunch of people chimed in to help me out. Well, with their help, and after reading some of the articles on A List Apart, I was able to get a very basic layout working in both IE and Firefox&amp;#8230; although it doesn&amp;#8217;t currently work in Opera, which surprised me a bit&amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>I like that Bungie is exposing your stats as RSS (see mine here), but it would be cooler if they had added some additional elements and attributes to the feed to describe the games in a more usable format, rather than just in HTML&amp;#8230; instead of;

      <description>A customer emailed me today (via the VB FAQ blog) with a question; &amp;#8220;how can I output text at different angles, to write the cardinal points around a compass for example&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221; so I decided to fire up a quick sample
Public Enum Direction As Integer
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;N = 0
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;NW = 1
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;W = 2
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SW = 3
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;S = 4
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SE = 5
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;E = 6
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;NE = 7
End Enum</description>

      <description>He was talking about the generic bad guys in the new Prince of Persia game, but this line crosses into Halo, and it is so true&amp;#8230;
 &amp;#8220;Halo has those little grunts, and I guess I&amp;#8217;m supposed to feel like a bad-ass when I destroy them but I actually just feel like an asshole. They both seem like races that just fell in with the wrong crowd. What they need are compelling after school activities, not death.</description>

      <description>Customizing the data grid (in Windows Forms) was always one of the most popular topics on the C# or VB developer centers, so I&amp;#8217;m sure a lot of people will be interested in this article. It is in C#, so far, but if you&amp;#8217;d like to see it in VB I&amp;#8217;d suggest you email the writer (email at the bottom of the article).

      <description>I received another interesting, and common, question today about using Enter instead of (or in addition to) the Tab key to move the focus between fields on a form. Well, that isn&amp;#8217;t too hard to accomplish, but it can get tricky once you consider all the different situations&amp;#8230;
First, the easy&amp;#8230; set your Form&amp;#8217;s KeyPreview property to true, override OnKeyUp (or OnKeyDown&amp;#8230; can&amp;#8217;t think of any real reason to use one or the other in this case), check for the Enter key, then call your Form&amp;#8217;s ProcessTabKey method.</description>

      <description>I read this PVP cartoon last week, talking about the free iPod thing, and now I&amp;#8217;ve seen similar things (free dvds, free pcs, free video games, etc&amp;#8230;) from the same company. After reading about it, I gave in.
I signed up for the Columbia deal personally, though the blockbuster offer seems &amp;#8216;free-er&amp;#8217; &amp;#8230; the whole thing is probably another one of those &amp;#8220;sign up for the free offer, because we know you are too lazy to remember to cancel before we start charging you money&amp;#8221; deals&amp;#8230; so check it out at your own risk 🙂</description>

I guess it isn&amp;#8217;t surprising that these things exist, someone created a difficult to follow process, so trust the gadget geeks to quickly try to &amp;#8216;automate&amp;#8217; it 🙂</description>

      <description>Google and various blog software vendors recently announced a method to deter comment spam by reducing its benefit to the spammer&amp;#8230; it sounds like a pretty good idea, so I updated my installation of .Text to use this new attribute in the comment section by adding just a single line within comments.cs: namelink.Attributes[&amp;#8220;rel&amp;#8221;] = &amp;#8220;nofollow&amp;#8221;; &amp;#8230; now, let&amp;#8217;s just hope it works 😉
I think I might enhance this a bit later, adding the idea of approved comments that don&amp;#8217;t get this attribute for their links, since I see no reason why a non-spammer&amp;#8217;s comment shouldn&amp;#8217;t give them google-juice.</description>

      <description>When I first came down to the US, I had to pick a doctor and go in for a physical, and when the doctor was done with all the various procedures he needed to perform, he asked me if I had any particular health concerns. I really only had one, but I didn&amp;#8217;t see the point in mentioning it, I didn&amp;#8217;t really think there was anything he would be able to do for me anyway.</description>

I have 4 out of the 8 referrals required for a free flat screen, 1 out of 11 for the free mini mac and none for the free Personal Video Player&amp;#8230; which makes sense actually, I blogged about the first, I&amp;#8217;ve never really talked about the mini mac one, but there is a little button link on this page so it gets a little bit of traffic, and I have never before mentioned the video player one&amp;#8230; so it isn&amp;#8217;t getting any traffic at all.</description>

      <description>The Outlook Web Access team is looking for web developers
Web-based mail is hot. Gmail, Hotmail, Outlook Web Access&amp;#8230; They&amp;#8217;re all making headlines and showing off the richness of the web. The Outlook Web Access team is looking for solid ASP.NET developers to help build our next version. We&amp;#8217;re looking for people with top-notch development skills, who have worked with C# and ASP.NET in the past and have a solid understanding of HTML, CSS and script.</description>

      <description>Wanted to get this into a better place for discussion than my blog comments&amp;#8230;. new forums here &amp;#8230; I should warn you though that I&amp;#8217;ve been having a ton of errors with the Forum code of late though. I&amp;#8217;ve even turned on full errors (bad, bad, duncan) as part of a desperate attempt to track down an annoying error in AspNetForums.Components.SiteUrls.LocationKey() &amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve mentioned it before, but it is worth saying again. When I decided to build my site up from its static beginnings and add on various asp.net-driven applications, I needed a host that provided SQL Server database access for a reasonable fee and easerve (Server Intellect&amp;#8216;s old name) came highly recommended. Turns out to be the best hosting decision I have ever made.
Once I realized the level of support and stability that this host provided, I decided to move my personal blog onto my own installation of .</description>

  Paul Vick &amp;#8211; Why would a VB 6.0&amp;#8217;er consider VB.NET?
If you&amp;#8217;re a Visual Basic 6.0 programmer, why would you consider moving to VB.NET? Paul talks to us about the trials and tribulations of learning VB.NET from the VB6&amp;#8217;er point of view. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;      Paul Vick &amp;#8211; What makes a great Visual Basic programmer?</description>

      <description>A few months ago, I posted a VB survey up onto my site. That survey received over 1000 responses and I believe it provided some useful data back to the Visual Basic team. I&amp;#8217;m considering put the results back up onto my site so you can see them, but I need to determine how much interest there is in seeing this information. Let me know via the comments if you think this would be useful and I&amp;#8217;ll get started on creating an HTML view of the info.</description>

This is for folks who are new to code and have decided that VB.NET is the way to get started into this world. I just put this reminder here in the hope of preventing a whole bunch of low ratings that say things like &amp;#8220;I already know this&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;I program in VS every day&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;Why are you writing about something so simple?</description>

Community Server combines the functionality of forums (based on the ASP.NET forums engine Rob worked on while at Microsoft), blogs (based on the very popular .Text engine created by Scott Watermasysk, who now works for Telligent), and photo gallery (based on nGallery, created by Jason Alexander, who&amp;#8217;s also one of the brains at Telligent).</description>

Cool stuff. Aaron is also the author of iRooster, an alarm clock application (that uses playlists from iTunes) which also looks neat, but runs on the Mac so it isn&amp;#8217;t something that I have any real use for&amp;#8230; :).</description>

      <description>Gratis, the company behind the various www.free***.com sites (and the original free iPod folks), provide banners for use on sites like mine, but they don&amp;#8217;t really keep them up to date. For example, the banner for the Free PC site is all about the Dell machine you can get, but they recently added a Sony Vaio as a possible choice. Now, I&amp;#8217;m not sure why, since its specs are not that different from the Dell, but the Sony machine just seems more appealing 🙂 &amp;#8230; here is Gratis&amp;#8217;s blurb on the new box:</description>

Well, the wait is over, Brad McCabe has joined the illustrious content strategist team at MSDN.

      <description>If you sign up for one of the sites created by Gratis (free flat screens, free ipods, free handbags, etc&amp;#8230;) then one of the available offers is Zooba.com, and I have to say it is one of the best offers I&amp;#8217;ve tried. Basically, if you are someone who likes to read then you probably won&amp;#8217;t mind the &amp;#8216;requirement&amp;#8217; to complete this offer. You sign up for a membership with Zooba, which costs around $10 a month and for that fee you get one hardcover book each month with no shipping costs.</description>

      <description>Richard Grimes posted some fairly negative thoughts around .NET and VB.NET specifically, comments that Scott decided to reply to with his own post.
I have to say that Richard&amp;#8217;s comments about C# vs. VB.NET are something that I hear all the time, that it is easy for a VB6 developer to pick up C#, and (just like Scott says) that just isn&amp;#8217;t true at all. To pick just one example, case-sensitivity is a language &amp;#8216;feature&amp;#8217; that leads to confusion and errors, and trying to work in that environment after growing up inside Visual Basic is a lot harder than people make it seem.</description>

As cool as that is, and while I&amp;#8217;m sure it has excellent tools/scripts for upgrading, I&amp;#8217;m not looking forward to it.</description>

      <description>On the various programming forums I read, a common question is &amp;#8220;how can I find out the IP address of my router&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230; for whatever reason (and there certainly are a few reasons that I can think of) people were really looking for their IP address on the Internet. In general, the solution was to hit one of a few publically available sites out there that display your IP when you view their web pages and then scrape the IP address back out of the HTML.</description>

      <description>I was searching the web for details on how best to take all the various body measurements that is a standard part of any personal training program, when my search brought me to this essay.
 Girls are indoctrinated at a very young age that Barbie is how a woman is supposed to look (i.e. no fat anywhere on your body, but huge breasts). NOTE: If Barbie were life-size, she would stand 5’9” and weigh 110 lb.</description>

      <description>No idea what we&amp;#8217;ve caught, but everyone in my family is sick&amp;#8230;. and it has lasted for three days so far. Fever, shivering, sniffling, coughing, ugh&amp;#8230; This was the first year that we all got flu shots and I&amp;#8217;ll tell you, we have never been sick so often 🙂
Of course, it is also Connor&amp;#8217;s first year in pre-school, so that could be a more likely cause&amp;#8230; all those germ-buckets playing together can really spread a cold around.</description>

      <description>Sign-ups seem to have plateaued, I posted that I had 2 left for the free flat screen site on February 16th, and I&amp;#8217;m still at the same point. What I do have though, is about 15 &amp;#8220;yellows&amp;#8221; which means a person signed up but never completed an offer&amp;#8230; everyone starts out yellow before going to &amp;#8220;green&amp;#8221; and becoming a valid referral counting towards the number you need, so all those yellows can lead to a false sense of accomplishment :).</description>

      <description>A friend of mine at work just asked me this VB question, and it is an interesting one to me because it isn&amp;#8217;t as simple as it seems&amp;#8230;
 How do I cast from Integer to IntPtr?
 In the end, I never really found an answer to that question, but I found out how to create a new IntPtr from an existing Integer and that seems close enough. You see, CType doesn&amp;#8217;t work because there isn&amp;#8217;t a defined conversion between the two types, and DirectCast only works with object references not value types like IntPtr.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve recently unhooked my Tivo&amp;#8230; I picked up a Media Center Extender (the HP one) and that was the final step to moving all of our television watching to MCE 2005. We love it and we record tons of shows. Extender works wonderfully, better than the XBox extender because there is no stupid DVD to put in to watch TV and it is a lot quieter.
Everything looks great, except for the occasional thing on some of the lower channels (5 and 6).</description>

Starting with BITS 1.5, you can also upload files&amp;#8230; is that topic of interest to folks? Just FYI, you need web server support to make this work, as detailed here.</description>

      <description>I use the Exception Handling Block from PAG, so exceptions anywhere in my application generate a nice (full of data) XML file for me to use after the fact to track down the problem&amp;#8230; but that file gets written to the user&amp;#8217;s local machine&amp;#8230; so I have to ask folks to send it to me via email. What I need to implement is some system to upload those reports to me either automatically or on-demand&amp;#8230;.</description>

      <description>This topic has been in the &amp;#8216;news&amp;#8217; lately (well, at least in the blogs) and I&amp;#8217;ve been considering replying&amp;#8230;. but it turns out I don&amp;#8217;t have to, because Dave Totzke has done it for me. I don&amp;#8217;t really agree with his comment that we&amp;#8217;ve kept C++ alive because Office is written in it&amp;#8230; it is actually because the managed world doesn&amp;#8217;t replace the need to write native code against the underlying hardware and OS.</description>

      <description>Check out my articles page, which is built from an RSS file by the way, and click on any of the &amp;#8220;Coding 4 Fun&amp;#8221; articles. You&amp;#8217;ll end up still in my site, but viewing the full MSDN article. Mostly I&amp;#8217;m just playing around, but it seemed &amp;#8216;neat&amp;#8217; enough to mention 🙂
By the way, the jury is still out on whether or not I&amp;#8217;ve opened myself to various new security risks through this code, so if you want to try and hack my site using this new &amp;#8220;pull&amp;#8221; concept, go for it&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;d really appreciate it if you&amp;#8217;d let me know if you find anything though, in the interest of science that is 🙂</description>

      <description>In my last post, I was talking about pulling my articles from MSDN into the chrome of my site. This type of system could be created using a frameset, but frames are evil, so that isn&amp;#8217;t the approach I took. Instead, knowing a bit about the files on MSDN&amp;#8217;s web servers, I took advantage of a special xml file that exists for most of our articles. This file is created as part of our publishing process and exists so that we can pull articles into the chrome of our developer centers (like this).</description>

I&amp;#8217;ve wrapped my code up into a user control that you place anywhere on your page&amp;#8230; it handles the load of data and then you can access its properties to output the html headers and body of the pulled content. I&amp;#8217;ve just been using Output Caching on the host page, but if you decided to cache the body/headers that would certainly work as well&amp;#8230;</description>

&amp;#8230; and these butterfly cookies. Recipe for the breadstick/caterpillars is here

      <description>Brian and I were chatting (arguing actually) about the PSP the other day at lunch&amp;#8230; I thought the idea of selling movies for the device, movies that you couldn&amp;#8217;t use in a DVD player at home, was crazy and Brian didn&amp;#8217;t. Brian&amp;#8217;s opinion is likely the more accurate one (it usually is), these PSP movies will probably sell, definitely at airports and for rentals and probably in less volume for normal use&amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>Lately I&amp;#8217;ve been luckily enough to be able to reuse several bits of code I&amp;#8217;ve written in Visual Basic 2002 and 2003, namely code from a few of my earlier MSDN articles (Design Surface and the Control series). Since I was planning to make a few changes, I pulled these projects into Visual Basic 2005 Beta 1 (instead of just referencing the already existing assemblies created with the .NET Framework 1.</description>

      <description>In my first post on this site, I mentioned an application that I wrote to copy blog posts from one .Text server to another. Overall, I didn&amp;#8217;t think the application had any real use after the web service I used was removed from the weblogs.asp.net servers, but I&amp;#8217;m posting it anyway for anyone who might find it useful.

Turns out, when I put my running shoes back on it feels fine, but I&amp;#8217;m not a fan of wearing running shoes with my regular work clothes so I went all out today and put on track pants and a T-shirt (along with my comfortable shoes, of course).</description>

      <description>I ran into a problem recently, where duplicate IDs were being generated by my offline ADO.NET code&amp;#8230; and I had no real idea why this was happening. I had set up the primary key of my DataTable to have the following propery values:
 AutoIncrement = true AutoIncrementSeed = -1 AutoIncrementStep = -1  This is supposed to result in offline IDs being assigned as -1,-2,-3 and therefore having no possibility of conflict with any real IDs used in the database.</description>

      <description>Ok, this may seem really odd, but I swear it happened to me&amp;#8230; 🙂
Yesterday I decided that I would hook up my headphones and listen to some music at work. I do this all the time at home, but not often in the office. I fired up media player on my laptop and started playing a variety of ripped WMA files. Then I opened up VS.NET 2003 and a fairly large project.</description>

      <description>I was mocking up a UI yesterday, and I wanted to produce an interface that looked like Front Page&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;New from Template&amp;#8221; dialog&amp;#8230;
But I couldn&amp;#8217;t easily replicate those little dividers (for Options, Description, Preview), so I created a &amp;#8220;DividerLabel&amp;#8221; with about 10 minutes of VB.NET code (2003)&amp;#8230;
And, if you are so inclined, you can set the text to nothing and you have a line!
The Code

      <description>It seems a few people had questions about the control I posted previously, so here are answers to two of the questions that people might be running into:
 What about word wrapping? Good point, turns out I hadn&amp;#8217;t quite finished my code before I got distracted by food or coffee&amp;#8230; and then I ended up leaving out word wrapping! You just need to modify 1 line to make wrapping work, though:</description>

      <description>If you&amp;#8217;ve been reading my blog for awhile, you probably know about my column &amp;#8220;Coding4Fun&amp;#8221;, well now there is an entire site on MSDN going by that name&amp;#8230; to be clear, this is not a site all about my column 🙂 &amp;#8230; it is a site dedicated to the same concept though, hobbyist coding.
Check it out at: http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun

      <description>Everytime Brian tells me something that involves his portable media center, I think about getting one. He has the Samsung model, which I really like the look/feel of and it seems to work well (although the length of transcoding is a reoccuring complaint), but my only real plan for getting one was to sign up with pvps4free.com (only 3 away from completion!), which has the Creative portable media center, but not the Samsung one.</description>

So, yep&amp;#8230; one of those sites worked for me&amp;#8230; it took a while, but my wife is very happy with the monitor. It is a 19&amp;#8243; LCD from Sony (the SDM-S93 I believe) and it looks nice replacing her 15&amp;#8243; CRT.</description>

      <description>If I ever get an Alienware machine, I suspect it would be their Media Center machine, but the preview images of these new Star Wars machines are quite tempting.
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
I wish they had a single PC though, not light/dark versions, I love the images they&amp;#8217;ve used for both&amp;#8230; it would be cool to have each &amp;#8216;side&amp;#8217; represented on the opposite sides of the PC. I&amp;#8217;m sure they&amp;#8217;ll never split the case out on its own, as the whole point of this PC is to get you to pick up their highest-end PC just because you can&amp;#8217;t resist the themed version.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been messing around with using XSL to display RSS on MSDN, as a simpler alternative to a custom ASP.NET control, and while it works perfectly in the core case (display all the items in a feed in a format), there are two additional requirements that were very easy to handle in a .NET class, but trickier (for me) in XSL.
 Display the top n items  Out of the full list, display n randomly picked items   For the first, it was pretty easy&amp;#8230; could be used to only output the top 5 items, for example&amp;#8230; For the second though, I was stumped for a bit&amp;#8230; then I came up with an idea.</description>

      <description>Back at the start of April, I signed up for a group fitness class at the pro club, the &amp;#8220;Boot Camp&amp;#8221; &amp;#8230; a twice-weekly (for two months) running-focused outdoor workout that was supposedly modeled after real military training. Well, it wasn&amp;#8217;t anything like what I remembered from going through basic training with the Canadian Military, but I don&amp;#8217;t think anyone in the class would have actually wanted that. Paying to have people yell at you is something that only a small group of people enjoy.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m not sure who invented this term, SAF, but it comes up often around folks who are into new technology for the home&amp;#8230; &amp;#8220;sure you might want to install a media center pc, but have you taken into account the spouse acceptance factor?&amp;#8221; or the more common, &amp;#8220;having to restart the cable modem sure reduces the SAF&amp;#8221;. With everything new seems to come a few annoyances, so the question is whether or not the benefits outweigh the issues&amp;#8230; and not in your opinion, but in the opinion of the rest of the people in your house.</description>

      <description>My wife commented tonight that my son (4) was going on at length about which planet was where in the solar system and how if you lived right next to the sun it would be too hot to live, etc&amp;#8230; and suggested we get him some books on the planets from the library. This got me to thinking about a book that I used to spend hours and hours reading, I probably read it through cover-to-cover over a hundred times over the years&amp;#8230; and a few searches later I found the title and author, Roy A.</description>

One of the more recent tricks is sending me a notice about my &amp;#8220;insert online service or bank here&amp;#8221; account and providing me a link to go and enter my userid/password&amp;#8230; and the link text is something like &amp;#8220;https://www.</description>

      <description>I used to get knee pain all the time, just walking down stairs would cause quite an ache, but after I dropped some weight that went away&amp;#8230; now it seems that pounding my legs onto the pavement over and over again is firing it back up again, and it is getting bad enough that I&amp;#8217;m feeling reluctant to run as often as I have been. Seeing me limp my way down the stairs into the changing room, someone that I was running with mentioned glucosamine, saying that it really helps repair the damaged &amp;#8216;stuff&amp;#8217; that is leading to the discomfort when I run down large hills.</description>

      <description>It was a very enjoyable summer weekend for our little family, including a trip today to pick raspberries (tons of fun, easy to pick&amp;#8230;) and strawberries (very tasty&amp;#8230; but much less enjoyable to be squatting down in the tiny little space between the rows trying to dig through the little bushes looking for ripe strawberries&amp;#8230;) out at a local place called Remlinger Farms.
We only picked for around an hour, at that is moving at the speed of a 4 year old, and ended up with a nice pile of berries.</description>

      <description>As my lack of posts might suggest, I&amp;#8217;m completely under water these days at work, but I did find time to take a week long vacation back to Winnipeg, Manitoba. While I was there I snapped this shot of a sign that I&amp;#8217;ve been amused by for a few years now&amp;#8230; (click the picture to see the full size version)
 I guess I would understand this text in a yellow-pages ad, if you know you have to find a place that offers this service you&amp;#8217;d be looking in that section of the yellow-pages and this would be useful information, but on a street-side sign doesn&amp;#8217;t make as much sense to me.</description>

      <description>A friend of mine, through my wife, has been a stay-at-home mom for the past few years and is trying to get back into the swing of computer programming. It doesn&amp;#8217;t take long to get out of date in the computer industry, so I can understand her desire to flex her coding muscles a bit. Although she could just go back to what she knew before, she has decided to try learning something that is completely new, which I think is a great way to go.</description>

      <description>My latest little “life adventure” got started on Wednesday last week… Brian and I had just grabbed coffees and I was back at my desk working through my list of bugs when I started to get a wicked ache in my gut. It was bad enough that I was having trouble concentrating so I headed home early and ended up there by four in the afternoon. Well, I felt pretty silly about it, having to come home early with a “tummy-ache”, but it just kept getting worse and I had to ask my family to make-do without me for a few hours while I tried to take it easy until this pain went away.</description>

      <description>This is an interesting idea &amp;#8230; http://www.exceptioncollection.com/, something that I&amp;#8217;ve pondered before...
I&amp;#8217;d have to know more about it, in terms of the privacy and security of their data collection&amp;#8230; before I could recommend it without any pause, but I would certainly take a look if you are building a widely distributed application (outside of a single company/enterprise), and I would probably try to integrate with the Exception handling/logging block from PAG.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve played around with coding against the Messenger APIs before, but it seems that MSN has really gone all out now and released a bunch of information for coding against their search, messenger, mapping services, and more&amp;#8230; check it out on MSDN as of today!

      <description>I noticed today that Gratis, the folks behind many of the more well-know &amp;#8220;free stuff&amp;#8221; sites have changed their name to &amp;#8220;FreePay&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230; which seems like a much suckier name than Gratis. Gratis was simple, but yet meaningful. FreePay starts with the right word, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t even make sense to me; I bet there was a legal reason behind the change.
Gratis was the company behind the free flat screen site through which I received my Sony LCD monitor, but the only sites I still follow are those run by OfferCentric, because they offer a wider range of &amp;#8216;gift&amp;#8217; choices, usually including a PayPal option (which seems almost as good as cash to me).</description>

      <description>Now, to me, VB 2005 is the &amp;#8220;future&amp;#8221;, and anything beyond that is really just coffee-break information to read briefly&amp;#8230;. but I guess I wouldn&amp;#8217;t be a very good Microsoft person if I didn&amp;#8217;t start pushing the version-after-next version of our development tools before the next version has even shipped.
So, with that in mind, check out http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/future/ which, despite my comments, is quite a good pile of info on post-Whidbey VB features and even includes a download to bring LINQ features in VB 2005.</description>

      <description>The RSS generator for MSDN, creator of this feed, and many more &amp;#8230; has a small problem. Way upstream, when various people inside the company enter information about an upcoming headline, they have the ability to specify a URL to a download. The intent was for this to be a URL to an actual downloadable file, so when I generate an RSS item from that headline entry, I take that URL and turn it into an enclosure entry in the RSS file.</description>

      <description>In an earlier post, I discussed the fact that the MSDN feeds were failing to validate due to a MIME type that included parameters (charset in this case, like &amp;#8216;text/html ;charset=utf-8&amp;#8217;), but I also posted a query about this issue into the listserv for FeedValidator.org. Sam mentioned it on his blog, and then went ahead and updated the validator to recognize a MIME type with parameter as valid.
In the meantime, I updated the MSDN generator to strip out the parameters :), but I still think they are technically valid so I&amp;#8217;m glad the feed validates as it is today (with params) and as it will exist in the near future with the MIME types stripped down to just type/subtype.</description>

      <description>I was just at Redmond Town Center, an open-air mall, and I saw a bunch of folks wearing t-shirts that read &amp;#8220;Joss Whedon is my master now&amp;#8221; (see here and here) &amp;#8230; and I started thinking; how well does this movie have to do to get the show back? Should everyone who loves it go see the movie twice? three times? Buy the DVD box set?</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been putting money aside for a few months now, to save up for an Xbox 360, and now I have sold my media center extender (the HP one), I&amp;#8217;ve hit the magical number to be able to afford the &amp;#8216;premium&amp;#8217; edition. I can&amp;#8217;t afford any of the crazy bundles that are available for pre-order though, so I guess I&amp;#8217;ll be waiting for a bit to pick one up after the release on November 22nd&amp;#8230;</description>

Of course, I&amp;#8217;ve just added this to my forked version of Kent&amp;#8217;s original code&amp;#8230; so any feature I add that he likes will need to manually added into his version&amp;#8230; bad software development practice, but hey we&amp;#8217;re just playing around here so you should be expecting too much.</description>

      <description>For the last few weeks I&amp;#8217;ve had a graphic and link to a &amp;#8216;free Xbox 360&amp;#8217; site up as a banner on my blog pages, and it has received a lot of clicks (and 12 or so sign-ups, although no one has completed an offer yet&amp;#8230;). I&amp;#8217;m guessing that with the difficulty of obtaining a pre-order at this close to the release, the idea of a free Xbox 360 is pretty appealing.</description>

      <description>I remembered that the 11th book in the Wheel of Time series, Knife of Dreams,&amp;nbsp;was coming out sometime in October so I checked for it on Amazon today and it turns out it came out on the 19th. So (despite being fairly busy and having a real problem with reading non-stop through every single book I get the moment it shows up) I ordered it. Maybe I can get it in time for my trip down to DevConnections in Las Vegas in November, then I can read it on the plane and in the hotel, it would help keep me out of trouble.</description>

      <description>Xbox 360 for Dummies
By Sean Lennox
A new book entitiled &amp;#8220;Xbox 360 for Dummies&amp;#8221; might be exactly what some of us need
The new Xbox 360 will be released on November 22nd here in North America.

      <description>I was reading the dotnetjunkies.com newsletter and I spotted these podcasts, a series of them that I have never noticed before, even though they definitely the kind of content I&amp;#8217;d be interested in hearing.
 [
Moving to .NET from VB6 and C++](http://devnet.developerpipeline.com/documents/dev051026dnc/ &amp;ldquo;http://devnet.developerpipeline.com/documents/dev051026dnc/&amp;quot;)
Juval Lowy discusses the different perspectives that VB6 and C++ developers
bring to .NET including the challenges each group faces with the technology.

      <description>I mentioned earlier how the Free Xbox 360 site was quite busy, and it is&amp;#8230; tons of clicks, 12 sign-ups, and even one person has &amp;#8216;gone green&amp;#8217; which is to say they completed their offer. Once 8 people (who click through your referral link) have signed-up and completed an offer, then you are all done, but the sign-up to completion ratio is not great, probably 1 in every 5, so a lot of folks sign-up and then find that they either are not interested in the available offers or they don&amp;#8217;t think it is likely that they&amp;#8217;ll get an additional 8 people to sign-up through them.</description>

      <description>I only recently noticed that my blog software (.Text 0.95) had atom support built in, so I added a button to my main page, and then I noticed it was Atom 0.3. Since 0.3 was recently deprecated, I updated the Atom generating code to output 1.0 instead and voila;
{.broken_link}
Much thanks to rakaz&amp;#8217;s great guide on moving from 0.3 to 1.0, which enabled me to update my code with almost no knowledge of Atom 0.</description>

      <description>Blogs and blogging software seem to be everywhere these days, and RSS has been a top buzzword for quite some time, everyone and their dog wants to take advantage of this new trend and technology. The problem is, it isn&amp;#8217;t a simple process to create and maintain a valid RSS file. If you aren&amp;#8217;t willing to run a complete blogging system or if you aren&amp;#8217;t capable of hand-editing XML, then you don&amp;#8217;t have a lot of options.</description>

      <description>Brian and I have been spending a lot of our free time working on an upcoming Xbox 360 book (Xbox 360 for Dummies), which has resulted in me spending way too much time thinking about the day I will be able to pick up a box of my own to bring home. Looking forward to that day, and knowing that Brian and I have almost completely different tastes in games, I thought it would be interesting to list out the 5 games on the 360 I&amp;#8217;m most looking forward to, and maybe Brian will do the same.</description>

      <description>Landed in Vegas for the conference, talk is on Thursday&amp;#8230;. I&amp;#8217;ll be talking about MSDN2.microsoft.com, but more specifically I&amp;#8217;ll be covering the use of the Virtual Page Provider feature in ASP.NET 2.0, so if that type of thing appeals to you, come by and check it out!</description>

      <description>I focused mainly on the Virtual Path Provider in ASP.NET 2.0, and how we use that to construct our pages on the new MSDN platform (visible live at http://msdn2.microsoft.com). I thought I should put up some links to additional information, starting with a link to the reference material currently available on the Virtual Path Provider.

      <description>This is the sort of thing that happens with large development teams, one team codes in &amp;#8216;fixes&amp;#8217; that break someone else&amp;#8217;s work&amp;#8230; I don&amp;#8217;t normally do this all by myself! I updated the Flairmaker to support Atom 0.3, then I updated my feeds to Atom 1.0 &amp;#8230; great.
See the error, laugh at the coder&amp;#8230; or will it be fixed by the time you click this?{.broken_link}</description>

      <description>You may have already noticed this, but the current build of MSDN2 has a bug in the way it colors VB code snippets, as you can see here (scroll down, there are quite a few problems in the code snippet coloring, see how many you can spot!)&amp;#8230; turns out the code wasn&amp;#8217;t handling comments right, text in quotes, and it didn&amp;#8217;t have a full list of the VB keywords (so MsgBox was not recognized, for example).</description>

The guy in the front of the line, who I believe will get his Xbox 360 from Bill Gates, had been waiting since Friday.
Stopped by Fred Meyer tonight to print out a digital photo, asked the guy if they were getting any 360 buzz&amp;#8230; they have 12 premium systems to sell, opening at 7am, and already over a 100 calls asking when they opened and when the line was going to start&amp;#8230; that is going to be a lot of disappointed folks&amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>About a year or so back I added  elements to the MSDN RSS feeds, which seemed like an obvious addition, but it wasn&amp;#8217;t until recently that I noticed that my own feeds (coming out of my .Text 0.95 based blogging engine) didn&amp;#8217;t have categories specified in them at all. Not in the main feed or in the per-blog feeds&amp;#8230;

      <description>Don&amp;#8217;t misunderstand, I enjoyed the book{.broken_link}&amp;#8230; but just like watching an episode of your favorite TV show and knowing that it will be another week until you can see another (or watching the Pegasus episode of Battlestar Galactica, knowing that it will be months before you see the conclusion of that story), I&amp;#8217;m always sad to see it end.
I put off reading the book at all for quite some time, figuring that once I started I would neglect other responsibilities (including some sleep) until it was done, and I also thought that it would be good to go back and re-read #10, so that the story flowed better for me.</description>

      <description>In the end, MSDN didn&amp;#8217;t end up needing the RSS editor I wrote, so I&amp;#8217;ve stripped out the features and content specific to their needs and started turning it into a more generic RSS creation tool. If you&amp;#8217;d like to see it, as it is, you can run it from a ClickOnce install point here on my site. There are more features coming, and I&amp;#8217;m revamping the style and behavior of the category system&amp;#8230;.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been working on some feed support in MSDN&amp;#8217;s new online platform (a beta of which is running http://msdn2.microsoft.com) and I had to decide what content-type to use when outputting a RSS feed. I knew this was a contentious issue in the past, but I thought it might have been resolved so I did some browsing of specs and discussions and ended up with the following links:
 A discussion on Sam Ruby&amp;#8217;s blog around content-type (the comments are the interesting part) This post by Dave Winer  I&amp;#8217;m sure I could find more, but it appears this was never really resolved&amp;#8230; using application/xml seems the most &amp;#8216;proper&amp;#8217;, but the concern is that some browsers don&amp;#8217;t know how to handle it &amp;#8230; so the other choice is text/xml (specifically text/xml; charset=utf-8 or else the charset will default to US-ASCII).</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been working (as part of a large team!) on the new platform for MSDN, which is up and running at http://msdn2.microsoft.com&amp;#8230; and now you can see prototype versions of the MSDN home page ontop of that same platform. Check it out here [http://beta.msdn.microsoft.com/default.aspx]. The new home page demonstrates some of the personalization/profile features that will end up on the final MSDN site in the near future.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve recently accepted a job with the Channel 9 team (working for Jeff and working with Adam, Erik, Robert, and Charles), and &amp;#8230; because I&amp;#8217;m mostly a one-job kind of guy, that means I have to stop working at MSDN. So, come January 16th, I&amp;#8217;ll be over in a new office at Channel 9, probably not coding anything yet as it always take a few days to get ramped up, connected to the right source trees, etc&amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>Kent pointed me to this article on xml.com, talking about the benefits of having direct actions available as links in your feeds. This is a good idea, but it is a good idea for any HTML content. If you are going to have a link at the bottom of a MSDN page saying &amp;#8220;give us feedback&amp;#8221;, it would be best to either make sure that link takes the user directly to a form to enter feedback or instead to let them enter their feedback right there on the page.</description>

      <description>Turns out it was a TV movie (Sword of Gideon), but still&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;m surprised that it isn&amp;#8217;t mentioned in any of the reviews/articles about &amp;#8216;Munich&amp;#8217; that I&amp;#8217;ve read so far&amp;#8230;. (IMDB info). Any one else seen the TV movie?</description>

      <description>As per the blog entry &amp;#8220;Feed icons{.broken_link}&amp;#8221; and using icons pulled from the new feedicons site. Hopefully MSDN will follow suit as well, which would probably be pretty easy&amp;#8230; it looks like they are mostly linking every instance of the &amp;#8216;old&amp;#8217; RSS icon to the same graphic. I&amp;#8217;ll suggest it and we&amp;#8217;ll see what happens.</description>

      <description>Along with Zooba.com, I&amp;#8217;ve kept my Audible membership as well&amp;#8230; (and Columbia House DVD and BMG Music &amp;#8230; oh, and Vonage&amp;#8230; ok, there are quite a few free offers that I ended up keeping!!). Audible is pretty handy for those of us who have the occasional long driving trip, I burned &amp;#8216;Getting things done&amp;#8216; onto CD along with &amp;#8216;Accidental Buddhist&amp;#8216; (3 CDs apiece) and it really made the time fly driving to and from my Mother&amp;#8217;s house up in BC&amp;#8230; never listened to anything in the car though, and while I take a few podcasts to the gym sometimes I&amp;#8217;ve never tried taking anything from Audible.</description>

      <description>Ok, so I must admit that the whole Live.com/Start.com thing looks so much like a &amp;#8220;Digital Dashboard&amp;#8221; (anyone else get into that fad when it was cool?) that I feel like I&amp;#8217;m back working on building my own components into the Outlook Today page&amp;#8230;. but cynicism aside, it is still a cool idea and the very open system for creating and adding your own gadgets rocks.

      <description>ReadMe Item of the Day (from The Coding Monkey)
 Was reading the Visual Studio 2005 SDK Readme and happened upon this rather humorous note:
 Setup fails if the installation path is customized to path with more than 128 characters excluding the drive letter and the slashes. (We realize it is ironic to put this information in a file that is installed by setup, but at least you know that we know about the problem you have already worked around).</description>

      <description>My book is about to come out (don&amp;#8217;t worry, I had a 360 to use while writing the book&amp;#8230; so my lack of one now does not reduce the accuracy of the book 🙂 ), and I work at a place with probably one of the world&amp;#8217;s highest concentration of Xbox 360 fans &amp;#8230;. and I don&amp;#8217;t have one yet. I pre-ordered from EB Games, but I didn&amp;#8217;t pre-order quite soon enough I guess (October), so they haven&amp;#8217;t gotten down to me yet.</description>

      <description>I love this&amp;#8230; and the funny thing was, I had just finished searching MSN for &amp;#8220;Phil Ringnalda&amp;#8221; (because I had forgotten his URL, well actually because I kept spelling his name wrong when I typed it as a URL) without much success.
 Phil Ringnalda: Searching Where I&amp;#8217;m Not Hated &amp;#8230; I don&amp;rsquo;t have any way of knowing whether Google first decided I was garbage, and then decided that made me a duplicate of other people aggregating me, or decided I was garbage because I was a duplicate of people duplicating me, but I know it isn&amp;rsquo;t helping: the only time you should let search engines index the output of an aggregator is when that&amp;rsquo;s the only place the feeds appear as HTML.</description>

      <description>Not to cause any form of infinite loop here, but I liked this comment from Betsy in her post about my post&amp;#8230;
 It&amp;#8217;s a great fit &amp;#8211; Duncan went from content strategy to development at MSDN most recently, and now he&amp;#8217;s going to be on the dev team of one of the most evangelical of teams.
 Nice to know other folks think I made a good decision&amp;#8230; not that I need reassuring of course 🙂</description>

Code is available for download here: Term Extraction (ZIP){.broken_link}.</description>

      <description>A discussion at work today, along with my earlier post about Phil&amp;#8217;s issues with Google and MSN, had me searching like crazy for this comment:
 &amp;#8220;I think they&amp;#8217;re also vulnerable to being locked out of sites because they&amp;#8217;ve missed the implicit bargain for search engines that my site being crawled results in listing for me. Without any public facing services how do I find out what value I am getting from allowing WebFountain to crawl my site ?</description>

      <description>Earlier I annouced that I was leaving MSDN{.broken_link}, and my last day has arrived. I&amp;#8217;m pretty excited about starting with the Channel 9 team next week though, my office here is empty and I&amp;#8217;ll be returning my MSDN machines today. Luckily for me, for the purposes of copying my old files over, I already have my new machine from the Channel 9 team, a Tecra M4 tablet PC. This is my first time using a Tablet, so I need to track down all the utilities and apps that will make the most of this cool convertible machine.</description>

      <description>Found the Media Center Sandbox today, via Erik Porter, and it is nice to see them using the newly blessed icon. I&amp;#8217;d suggest they use a smaller one though, and update the feed icon next to their blogroll to be consistent&amp;#8230; but otherwise its great 🙂</description>

      <description>Yesterday I posted about the use of the feed icon on Media Center Sandbox and suggested a few changes. Last night, I get an email from Charlie Owen, one of the principals of the sandbox site, and the site is completely updated. Now, I don&amp;#8217;t know if I caused any change or if the change was just in the works anyway&amp;#8230;. but regardless, I like the new look and the icons look great!</description>

      <description>I run Windows Server 2003 as my dev server at work, so I&amp;#8217;m used to having the ability to run multiple web sites (main branch on 80, debug build on 88, another project on 8080, etc&amp;#8230; ) in fact, I&amp;#8217;m not just used to it&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;m spoiled by it. I don&amp;#8217;t like developing or debugging in a vroot, when I know the final app will be living at the root. I don&amp;#8217;t like using Cassini if the final app will be running in IIS (they are different in many important ways, such as the file types that end up going through the ASP.</description>

      <description>With their SDK{.broken_link}, search results as RSS, and ability to limit searches by site (so you can do queries like MSDN site:duncanmackenzie.net), I think I&amp;#8217;ll be able to provide a nice little &amp;#8216;cross property&amp;#8217; search for my blog and my personal site. Replacing the google search box on my site isn&amp;#8217;t a big priority for me, but writing this widget might be useful to other folks as well&amp;#8230; but until MSN gets an AdSense like program, Google is likely to own at least a part of my web site real estate 🙂</description>

      <description>From the &amp;#8220;Guys with Towels&amp;#8221; blog, which is a very funny site in general, comes a drive space utility. Like most of us, Tim has written this application when he probably should have been working 🙂

      <description>Ok, you&amp;#8217;ll be glad to hear that I won&amp;#8217;t be whining any more about not having an Xbox 360. My pre-order from EB Games still hasn&amp;#8217;t come in, but a friend of mine knew someone who had waited in line to get a 360 on launch day and then had their pre-order come in&amp;#8230; so they were willing to sell me their second Xbox 360 at cost. Lucky me, I picked it up yesterday and took it home, then set it up after the kids were in bed.</description>

      <description>Perhaps a little bug left over from when they first launched in Japan, but the MSN Spaces feeds seem to specify a language code for at least one english language feed (Brian&amp;#8217;s)&amp;#8230; but it does return en-US for some others. Hmm&amp;#8230; it also seems to specify en-US for some feeds that are quite obviously not&amp;#8230; perhaps choosing your language is a per-blog setting that people aren&amp;#8217;t aware of? I&amp;#8217;m not sure if it matters all that much, other than to blog indexers, if the character set and encoding is correct, the lanugage element isn&amp;#8217;t really important to aggregators or browsers, but since it changes from feed to feed it must be based on some sort of per-blog or per-user setting.</description>

      <description>Wow, I&amp;#8217;m new to the team and I guess I&amp;#8217;ve missed some of the C9 content over the past few years&amp;#8230;. and, as the video description says &amp;ldquo;the second time we&amp;#8217;ve had Bill on C9&amp;rdquo; so maybe this isn&amp;#8217;t as unusual as I think&amp;#8230;. but this still really surprised me. I didn&amp;#8217;t expect to see an inteview with the man himself on there. Bill Gates sat down with Charles Torre and chatted about Mix06, Office and more&amp;#8230; check it out here.</description>

      <description>80 now I think, after a quick bit of Ridge Racer{.broken_link}&amp;#8230;. but an overall low score. I&amp;#8217;m told that I need to just play more games, but we&amp;#8217;ll see how I do with my current set of&amp;nbsp; PDZ, PGR3,DOA4 and&amp;nbsp;Ridge Racer. Ridge Racer is a really different racing experience than PGR3, where I&amp;#8217;ve been spending most of my time&amp;#8230; not sure if I like it yet, but I&amp;#8217;ll give it a bit of time, that&amp;#8217;s the whole reason I get these games through GameFly &amp;#8230; try before you buy.</description>

      <description>Hitting this page (http://www.voodoopc.com/showroom.aspx?productID=1076) with IE7 produces several javascript alerts letting me know that I&amp;#8217;m running an &amp;#8220;Old Browser&amp;#8221;. Now, I&amp;#8217;m assuming that this is a bug in their version detection code, but even so&amp;#8230; is that what they show to someone running Netscape 4 or IE 5&amp;#8230; &amp;#8220;Old Browser&amp;#8221; ?

      <description>My dad has recently retired from the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police), but I&amp;#8217;m sure his opinion of a game like Need for Speed: Most Wanted wouldn&amp;#8217;t be any better just because he isn&amp;#8217;t going to work anymore. In this game, if you haven&amp;#8217;t played it already, you are a street racer&amp;#8230; so you race on open streets with traffic all around, buildings and other property to smash through&amp;#8230; as opposed to a game like PGR3 where you are nice and safe closed courses with all the people safely tucked behind concrete and steel barriers.</description>

      <description>I picked up my copy of Elder Scrolls last night, turning down the massive &amp;#8216;guide&amp;#8217; (shouldn&amp;#8217;t I be figuring out the quests by myself?), and after putting the kids to bed I fired it up. Hard to make those initial race/class decisions as always but I went with a Dark Elf Archer, under the sign of the Steed&amp;#8230; planning to put a lot of time/points into Blade though, as I almost always do with my RPG characters (my AC character was named Kendo, so you can gather that the sword was a key component).</description>

      <description>So, another blog post in my series about how much I&amp;#8217;m enjoying Oblivion&amp;#8230; I really want to buy Blazing Angels, but it seems pointless to get it right now&amp;#8230; I know I won&amp;#8217;t play it. At this point, I probably haven&amp;#8217;t play anywhere nearly as much as a more dedicated (some one with no children, and without a job that tends to lead to working in the evening?) gamer. But I&amp;#8217;m still having a great time.</description>

      <description>Personally, I always hated it when people in various product groups at Microsoft would ask me to blog about a specific launch or event&amp;#8230; because if I decided to do it, my blog post would go up into a sea of similar posts all appearing within a few hours of each other on blogs.msdn.com. How does that make you, the reader, feel? Like you are having information pushed at you through a channel that is normally about technical matters.</description>

      <description>I wrote my own for Trackbacks, which I used to incorporate trackbacks into http://on10.net, but Geoff provides one on his blog (that doesn&amp;#8217;t appear to support comments, but does support trackbacks, so I thought I had better blog about it to thank him) that does both.
Silly me, I hadn&amp;#8217;t built pingback support into on10.net, thinking that Trackbacks would handle most cases&amp;#8230; but it turns out that many sites (including wordpress) only send pingbacks&amp;#8230; oh well, at least it will be there after our next sprint.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve remarked to a few people that writing a more &amp;#8216;consumer&amp;#8217; focused book has been quite different from my usual area of writing (covering programming topics mostly), but this takes the cake.
Gadget Models, a site that seems to combine the two popular topics of models and technology, has run a feature that includes our book. Sadly, we weren&amp;#8217;t at all involved. Note to anyone who is worried about the content of the site itself, I didn&amp;#8217;t look through it all but it doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to cross into nudity or anything like that&amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>The source behind several of our questions for the recent Major Nelson bit on 10 is revealed, thanks Xbox Elle!
   A fun little game show, How well do you know your box(or is it Xbox? I can&amp;#8217;t tell), was posted to on10.net on Friday. Laura and Tina try to stump Major Nelson with a bunch of trivia questions, and guess what, three of them were mine! Tee hee!</description>

      <description>I was browsing around on Randy&amp;#8217;s web site after reading about an upcoming session of his at Makers Faire (hacking USB keyboards!!), and I found this: http://www.randywritesletters.com/005.html
All of the letters on that site (which has little or no navigation elements, so just edit the URL appropriately to go up to the front page) are hilarious, but for some reason I find this one to be the best&amp;#8230; let me know if you disagree.</description>

      <description>So I&amp;#8217;m back from the San Francisco area, and I&amp;#8217;m while I&amp;#8217;m too tired to give you all the details right now, here&amp;#8217;s a sneak peak of some of the things you&amp;#8217;ll be seeing on 10 in the near future:


Update: the first Maker Faire video is up on 10 right now!{.broken_link}
Update 2: For some reason, this post is #1 on several search engines for the query &amp;#8220;How hot is a flamethrower&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230; and I suspect that people who find this entry aren&amp;#8217;t really getting that question answered 🙂 In the interest of helping those folks out, I&amp;#8217;ve dug up a bit of an answer.</description>

      <description>This is from a great blog &amp;#8220;SuburbanJoe&amp;#8221; :
 &amp;#8220;The fact that it is pronounced like &amp;#8220;we&amp;#8221; lets them say silly things like &amp;#8220;Wii are going to change gaming&amp;#8221; and the double lowercase &amp;#8220;i&amp;#8221; is supposed to be evocative of both the controller and the ability for people to play together as it looks like two people standing next to each other. Two limbless, hairless, featureless people who live next to a giant &amp;#8220;W&amp;#8221;.</description>

      <description>This group, http://www.bridgesweb.org, is an amazing example of what I think http://on10.net is all about. Phil Borges and the other folks involved with this non-profit devote an enormous amount of time to travelling the world and helping kids tell their stories using the new technologies available today. Here is a shot I took today of one of the workshop participants (Mel) helping one of the kids (Stefano?) take some great shots of a steam engine&amp;#8230; and yes, I suck at remembering names!</description>

      <description>This is one of the cooler bits we&amp;#8217;ve run on 10 so far;
 CalCars&amp;#8230; Taking a Prius Hybrid to 100+ MPG!
&amp;#8230;talks to the founder of CalCars and learns how they can convert a Toyota Prius so that it can be charged using your household electricity &amp;#8230; power that is a whole lot cheaper than the gas a normal Prius uses to generate all of its electric power. Learn how they make this work, and how much easier it would be for Toyota to make their hybrids work this way in the first place&amp;#8230;</description>

It is a slightly different style of video than what you are used to from on10.net, but you can expect to see a wide variety of topics and styles on the site over time.</description>

      <description>If I told you that I was a recovering alcholic, would you offer me a drink? I doubt it, unless you are a real bastard. Well, Adam Kinney (my boss at on10.net) and I have been having many discussions about RPGs and MMORPGs (Oblivion, Asheron&amp;#8217;s Call and WoW being the main topics). I told him that I used to play a ton of AC, but I found that it was a real drain on my time and that I finally had to quit it so that I could stop spending my nights up until 2 am playing&amp;#8230; so what does he do?</description>

      <description>I just got to my hotel (the Aladdin) here in Vegas; ready to roam around the conferences looking for folks to film for Channel 9 (or 10, if the topic fits). Hmm&amp;#8230; Vegas and a video camera&amp;#8230; could be trouble. 🙂
If you are in town, email me or call me at the hotel, especially if you have an idea about something to film!</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve recently taken a little break from playing Oblivion, which had been the only disc in my 360 for the past couple of months, and I decided to try a range of games. While working on our book, Xbox 360 for Dummies, I added every single 360 game to my Q on Gamefly.com, so I end up getting a random selection whenever I send back the previous game.
This month, I returned Full Auto (interesting idea, combining guns and driving, but after playing PGR 3, Ridge Racer 6, and Need For Speed: Most Wanted&amp;#8230; it just didn&amp;#8217;t seem like my kind of driving game) and ended up with Rumble Roses XX.</description>

      <description>Chris Pirillo is on 10 today, chatting about Gnomedex, his tendency to write things on his chest, and more. I don&amp;#8217;t know Chris myself, but I joined his &amp;#8220;FatBlasters&amp;#8221; mailing list awhile ago as part of my ongoing quest to lose weight&amp;#8230; and also as a way to get emails from Chris in my Inbox every few days 🙂
Oooh, just noticed he has a Torrent setup for Vista as well, cool stuff</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking lately that blogging, podcasting and video blogging (vlogging?) show how individuals are able to create content so easily that the wave of independent content producers are sometimes more powerful than the large organizations they are competing with. This is not a new thought, but what I saw today certainly made me think it again.
Jyve is a Skype based app that lets individuals register themselves as experts in certain fields (French teacher, AJAX development, iPods, whatever) and then people can contact them (searching through Jyve&amp;#8217;s directory of all the registered experts by topic) and start a Skype call (chat and email are also available) with them.</description>

      <description>We ran a father&amp;#8217;s day themed bit on 10 on Friday, but if you are into gadgets you&amp;#8217;ll probably like it regardless of the day. I like the Superman laptop from Alienware, the rather simplistic graphic appeals to me. For the desktops, I believe I liked the Star Wars ones better, but they no longer seem to be available. (actually, I couldn&amp;#8217;t find any info about them on the site&amp;#8230; but I tried out the old links and they seemed to still work&amp;#8230;) Of course, the most appealing thing is probably the wi-fi finder&amp;#8230; it is a bit more in my price range than the other gadgets&amp;#8230; actually it isn&amp;#8217;t, but the cheaper wi-fi spotters probably are.</description>

 While I was there, I noticed they are running another contest as well, for an Alienware PC, tied to the release of Jade Empire for the PC. And, while we are on the subject of BioWare, we might as well mention Mass Effect (Big BioWare RPG for the Xbox 360)!!</description>

      <description>I was down in Las Vegas a couple of weeks ago, and I had a chance to film a bunch of cool eBay based applications&amp;#8230; videos should end up online soon. Some for Channel 9, some for 10 &amp;#8230; it all depends on the topic.

This is a shot of me interviewing one of the guys behind mceAuction, Christoph Buenger (CEO of Scendix).</description>

      <description>Sometimes I don&amp;#8217;t like being just the guy behind the scenes 🙂
It isn&amp;#8217;t anyone&amp;#8217;s fault, everyone on our team is aware of the work I do, but sometimes I wish it was more visible to the public. I guess it is because I&amp;#8217;m used to writing articles, that have my name so prominently attached, or blog posts that are so clearly mine&amp;#8230; but when I work on videos for 10, I can be the guy who set up the interview, contacted all the right folks to make it happen and even (in this case) went over and held the camera&amp;#8230; but yet, my name doesn&amp;#8217;t end up anywhere in the video or the post.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m in Winnipeg for a couple of weeks, and while I&amp;#8217;m there I thought I&amp;#8217;d track down a few interesting folks to film for on10.net. First up on my list, Ed from www.geektragedy.com. I can&amp;#8217;t figure out a way to permalink it, but if you can find the entry for June 28 (scroll down, or go to his archives if it has left the page) you&amp;#8217;ll see his comments on my visit&amp;#8230; I left thinking I should have asked him for a signed copy of a sketch or something like that and he makes it sound like I was doing him a favour by filming him&amp;#8230; humble guy!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m at my nephew&amp;rsquo;s place for a bit and he just &amp;lsquo;bricked&amp;rsquo; his PSP. He put in a game and it started to do a firmware update&amp;#8230; he didn&amp;rsquo;t understand what it was doing and was worried it was going to mess up his PSP, so he turned the power off.
Now, it won&amp;rsquo;t even power up. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking we are screwed at this point&amp;#8230; unless I can find some solution on the Internet&amp;#8230; but I&amp;#8217;m going to head down to the local Sony store tomorrow to see what they have to say.</description>

      <description>Update on the bricked PSP&amp;#8230; So I spoke to a someone at the local Sony retail store&amp;#8230; $120 (CDN) to fix the PSP. Keeping in mind that all that my nephew did was turn it off when he saw a dialog he didn&amp;#8217;t understand, that is a lot of money. I&amp;#8217;m especially unhappy because I know that this must be a common issue and a simple fix (open it up, flash the chips to the factory default firmware and then maybe re-update to the latest firmware&amp;#8230; all simple procedures, but ones that only Sony can do once the machine refuses to start up).</description>

      <description>As a few folks already know, I like portable media devices&amp;#8230; and I have a couple myself (I had the Samsung, it got smashed&amp;#8230; now I have a iRiver PMC and a Creative Labs PMC.. if you are interested in getting one for free&amp;#8230; check this out)&amp;#8230; and I use them on trips with the kids. My normal usage is to just pull TV onto them from Windows XP Media Center Edition, but the kids often want to watch one of their DVDs&amp;#8230; so I decided to rip all of our family-friendly DVDs to WMVs.</description>

Now I generally pick up a graphic novel or a compilation every once in awhile (just read this and this, great writing and visuals) mostly Marvel although the Watchmen and some of the Dark Knight stuff can&amp;#8217;t be passed up&amp;#8230; Recently though, my wife read a book and strongly recommended it to me: The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp;amp; Clay by Michael Chabon (also the author of Wonder Boys, Summerland and more)</description>

      <description>Good times were had by all, although mostly by my son (Connor)!
{.broken_link}
Played in the fountain, ate some hotdogs and did a few rides (very few) at the fair that sits below the Space Needle (you can see the needle in the back of this shot).
My high-point of the trip? When my son looked over a perfect stranger in line (a guy, probably around my age&amp;#8230; no kids with him) and asked for a bite of his cotton candy.</description>

      <description>I saw this on Techie Diva today&amp;#8230; and it was immediately appealing, but the attraction dimished quickly. This isn&amp;#8217;t any fault of the software, as far as I know it does its job perfectly, but I just don&amp;#8217;t think this is the way to deal with this problem. I have given parental control over technology a lot of thought lately, not only because I have two kids of my own, but also while writing the parental control chapter (a chapter I&amp;#8217;m really proud of, I think it is a great bit of info for parents) in Xbox 360 for Dummies.</description>

      <description>Ok, so I have to admit something&amp;#8230; when I saw Assassin&amp;#8217;s Creed in the various E3 videos, I was sad. The game looked amazing, but I&amp;#8217;m not going to buy a PS3 &amp;#8230; you can see my dilemma.
Then I see this on Joystiq &amp;#8230; and considering God of War II is a PS2 title (not that I have a PS2, but I&amp;#8217;m thinking about it&amp;#8230; more on the later) &amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp; there isn&amp;#8217;t anything announced yet for the PS3 that I feel like I&amp;#8217;m going to miss.</description>

      <description>Ok, so this is interesting to me, maybe not to everyone. Go to this page{.broken_link} on on10.net, and notice the lack of CSS&amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp; We are using ASP.NET themes and the CSS for the theme gets inserted as a relative reference (../../../themes etc.) &amp;#8230; well IE does the calculation based off of the URL and doesn&amp;#8217;t find the CSS because the extra slash confuses it.
I went into our code and added a check, if the absolute path of our request contained a double slash, then replace it with a single and redirect.</description>

      <description>This is so very cool&amp;#8230; I wonder if they need any programmers? Of course, my wife wouldn&amp;#8217;t like it if it meant lots of travel!
 When you think of natural disaster, software programs rarely come to mind. But Ted Okada and Robert Kirkpatrick of Microsoft’s Humanitarian Systems know from experience that where there’s a crisis, software can be a life-saver. On the front lines of war, earthquakes and floods Ted and Robert develop software applications that aid rescue efforts, assist medical workers, expedites counting and locating displaced people and helps disperse badly needed resources.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, Laura and I headed over to the offices of Penny Arcade to interview them about&amp;#8230; well, about a variety of things, it was a very interesting interview.

It may be hard to believe, but this was the best picture I could get. Someone&amp;#8217;s face is covered up in each and every shot I took, for some reason everyone was feeling very &amp;#8216;gesturey&amp;#8217; that day. At least Jerry wasn&amp;#8217;t covered up 🙂</description>

This site is definitely my latest happy discovery on the old series of pipes we call the Internet. As someone who takes lots of photos and almost every one of them ends up being one of my kids&amp;#8230; this site is perfect.

      <description>I was surprised early to hear that God of War II was a PS2 game&amp;#8230; and now this? I think it just the price that is scaring developers&amp;#8230; scary to develop for a console that seems out of the price range of your target audience. I say &amp;#8220;seems&amp;#8221; because despite my own (biased) negative thoughts about the PS3, I expect it to be a pretty impressive machine&amp;#8230; one that quite a few people will pick up.</description>

      <description>Last year I managed to go from 205-ish down to around 175 … just by following the South Beach Diet and working out more consistently (shooting for 5 days a week, generally hit 4 at least)… but then I switched jobs to work on a new project (http://on10.net{.broken_link}, a site that has featured Chris a few times) and totally fell off the wagon. Now I’m 187 (for months I’ve been putting 180 into the treadmill, but I actually weighed myself Monday night) and I’m really depressed about it.</description>

Shots of dolls in full-on fashion photo shoots. This would be a great way to practice your photography skills. Who needs models?

      <description>on10.net has a good interview up about the new blogging tool from the Windows Live team{.broken_link}. What&amp;#8217;s cool about this app? For a developer, there is tons to be excited about, including a very easy to use SDK (wrote some plug-in code last night, super easy) and it ships with&amp;nbsp;a bunch of .NET assemblies that I&amp;#8217;m about to go spelunking through&amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>Sampy and I stopped by the main doors of PAX last night around 1am and there was already two groups of folks waiting. Some guys from Detroit were first in line, having come in by train earlier that day, and they covered the full range of video gaming interests (although no one in their group was into tabletop gaming, the other major side to PAX) with one big Nintendo fan, an Xbox lover, and a PC gamer 🙂</description>

      <description>So I&amp;#8217;ve been wanting to go to PAX since it started a couple of years ago, and every time it has come around I&amp;#8217;ve been out of town&amp;#8230; until now&amp;#8230; and, by some interesting twist of fate, I know have a job that actually required me to attend 🙂
So Tina, Sampy, Adam and I headed over there today, snuck in ahead of the massive line with our snazzy media badges and started filming&amp;#8230; some highlights</description>

      <description>PAX was a blast, I went back for day 2 and spent almost all the day at the exhibition hall&amp;#8230; tons of cool demos and people! I was able to stop at the Xbox booth and chat with Trixie{.broken_link} (as Brian mentions here), which was great because she is one of those people that I&amp;rsquo;ve emailed quite a bit but never met in person.
I also managed to run into Frank O&amp;rsquo;Connor from Bungie and interview him about the Halo 2 team that Bungie was entering into the console tournament, which seemed really unfair but he assured me that they weren&amp;rsquo;t that good of players 🙂</description>

      <description>Not that it affects you, the reader, all that much&amp;#8230; but I&amp;#8217;m getting around 9000 spam comments a day now. It is crazy. I&amp;#8217;d add code to avoid them, but I&amp;#8217;m just finishing up a move to some new blog software that Adam and I wrote (you can see it running on Adam&amp;#8217;s site already) and I don&amp;#8217;t really want to spend any more time in the .Text code base&amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>I was browsing on www.xamlog.com and I found this tutorial on &amp;#8220;Reflection using Visual Brush and Opacity Mask&amp;#8220;, which shows you how to produce this effect:
with very little code/markup.
&amp;nbsp;
Hmm&amp;#8230; now that I finally have Vista up and running, it might be worth giving it a try.</description>

      <description>As I&amp;#8217;ve mentioned before, I have a Gamefly subscription and I get new games every few weeks&amp;#8230; a great way to play a lot of games without the risk of paying $60 for a stinker (OverG Fighters for example&amp;#8230; oh so happy I rented that instead of buying). Anyway, my most recent game is Chromehounds and I&amp;#8217;m really enjoying it.&amp;nbsp;It plays way more &amp;#8216;real&amp;#8217;&amp;nbsp;than a game like MechAssault, but isn&amp;#8217;t attempting to be a simulator and force you to control all the details a real mech would need dealt with.</description>

      <description>For quite some time I&amp;#8217;ve thought Pageviews were a mostly useless number to be tracking for any web site. This was very clear at MSDN, where such stats are tracked very carefully&amp;#8230; spreadsheets are created&amp;#8230; charts are made&amp;#8230; and yet, none of us really believed in the Pageview #s. Instead we used to focus more on unique visitors or an odd calculated value we called unique page views (not everyone&amp;#8217;s definition of that # is the same, but suffice it to say that is an attempt to more accurately represent real site visits by real people).</description>

      <description>I think we have a real design flaw here&amp;#8230; one of those &amp;#8216;neat ideas on your dev box&amp;#8217; that maybe shouldn&amp;#8217;t have really been implemented.
Check out this Technorati search for Temporary Post Used For Style Detection&amp;nbsp;to see what I&amp;#8217;m talking about. It isn&amp;#8217;t even something I get a choice about (every time I go to a different machine and configure&amp;nbsp;my blog, I get a test post&amp;#8230;).

      <description>With the release of Scramble today, I noticed something odd on the game detail page on Xbox.com. Along the&amp;nbsp;left hand side is a listing of the specs of the game (# of players, does it work with Live, etc.) and it includes this interesting line: &amp;#8220;HDTV 480i&amp;#8221;
&amp;nbsp;
Hmm&amp;#8230;. while I&amp;#8217;ve never subscribed to the view that only 1080p is HDTV, 480i is most certainly not. Yes, it is one of the resolutions that a HDTV monitor can usually display, but if it isn&amp;#8217;t 720p, 1080i or 1080p you can&amp;#8217;t really call it HDTV.</description>

      <description>In a recent post on Microsoft 10, Alfred talks about the idea and controversy around having students equipped with laptops. Check out his post for the full details, but to summarize&amp;#8230; it can work well, but it has to be done right, with the right software and teachers&amp;#8230; I agree with Alfred on this, but I also think it isn&amp;#8217;t that big of a surprise. This same concept applies in just about everything whether it is software engineering, fitness or even lawn care.</description>

      <description>Which isn&amp;#8217;t a big deal, but it is amazing to me that the same comic can sometimes make me produce&amp;nbsp;some form of giggle/snort/outburst&amp;nbsp;every single time I see it. After viewing this comic once, I was going back and forth between browsers and it ended up coming up a few different times. Maybe four times. I laughed every time.
On a related note, these two comics produce the same effect&amp;#8230; especially when viewed together.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been pondering categories vs. tags in blogs, in my sites (such as http://on10.net){.broken_link} we&amp;#8217;ve completely done away with the concept of categories as distinct entities from tags, which works fine on the site but is causing me a bit of a headache when I look at blog editing and blog editing APIs.
I&amp;#8217;ve enabled the metaweblogapi on my sites so that standard blog editing tools like performancing, windows live writer, etc&amp;#8230; can be used by our staff to post entries, and I&amp;#8217;ve used the &amp;#8216;categories&amp;#8217; area of that API to represent tags.</description>

      <description>Some people have great ideas, like Tom Werner&amp;#8217;s Gravatar (Globally Recognized Avatar) site&amp;#8230; a single place on the web to upload an avatar that any blog software can then retrieve using a fairly easily constructed URL. Neat stuff, I think I&amp;#8217;ll add it to my site.</description>

      <description>Wow, very cool stuff. Another fun example of how little Microsoft employees know about Microsoft products (I learned about this game from gamespot!) but still, very exciting. Another RTS for the 360 too; I&amp;#8217;m playing Battle for Middle Earth now so I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to the idea of a second RTS to play from my couch!

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve talked about losing weight before, and I managed to lose a fair bit via the South Beach diet about a year and a half ago, but my weight recently started creeping up again and I decided to do something &amp;#8216;big&amp;#8217; to get on the right track (which is something I&amp;#8217;ve considered before). So, on Tuesday of last week I had my official first appointment with a dietitian as part of the 20&amp;frasl;20 program at the Pro Club, which included a weigh-in 🙂 .</description>

Since I&amp;#8217;m a bit of an Zune enthusiast, Laura and Jesse ran camera and I handled asking the questions of Matt Jubelirer, the Zune team member who was there to show me the device (three devices, he had one of each color with him!</description>

      <description>I love Winnipeg, but&amp;nbsp;it doesn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;normally get all that many developer focused talks&amp;#8230; so if you live there and you are interested in .NET based web development, you should really get down to this event.

      <description>TotemBall, the gesture-based game that works with the Xbox Live Vision camera, just shipped to the Xbox Live Marketplace. It is a free download, but you need to have the camera to play. While you are waiting for it to download, check out my video demo of TotemBall up on 10.</description>

      <description>Having finished my first week in the 20&amp;frasl;20 weight loss program, and having lost 5lbs (or 2.7% of my weight, to put it in more relative terms), they&amp;#8217;ve graciously allowed me to add veggies back in. Not too much of course, but a couple of cups of lettuce go a long ways towards making a chicken breast seem like a real meal.</description>

      <description>Sometimes it is hard to know what you are getting on the marketplace, especially with themes and gamer pics, but in general there is a lot of content and it isn&amp;#8217;t always easy to find what you are looking for. Well, it seems that will be less of a problem, thanks to the launch of the &amp;#8220;Xbox Live Pipeline&amp;#8221; an online site to let you dig around through the available marketplace content, complete with descriptions and preview images.</description>

      <description>Fairly mixed response over on MajorNelson.com to this game, mostly either people who love it or people who are wishing we&amp;#8217;d stop with the &amp;#8216;retro&amp;#8217; games already&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;m a bit on the fence here myself, I like these games (Dig Dug, Time Pilot, Pac Man&amp;#8230;) but I&amp;#8217;m pretty disappointed that they&amp;#8217;ve been left so &amp;#8230; &amp;#8216;pure&amp;#8217; &amp;#8230; I mean, I think it would be cool to have an &amp;#8216;original&amp;#8217; game mode that only uses a fraction of the pixels of my TV, but I would really like to see another mode (one that I think would be really popular) where the graphics really are on par with what we&amp;#8217;d expect on a 360.</description>

      <description>As you may have noticed, I&amp;#8217;ve been playing with Soapbox lately and it is rocking. Yep, there are other sites out there, but I&amp;#8217;ve been finding the quality (it is all flash video folks, but there is still a range of quality) of the videos I&amp;#8217;ve uploaded to Soapbox to be a few steps above the other sites (or is it just site now that Google bought YouTube?). Laura Foy from on 10 went and interviewed the Soapbox team and managed to get a special link so that on10.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve recently begun re-reading the Deverry novels; I just went through Daggerspell, Darkspell and I&amp;#8217;m onto The Bristling Wood (basically &amp;#8216;Act 1&amp;#8217; as the author has described the books as being the various parts of a long play). This is an excellent series, but one that I found quite by accident.
Back when I was a fairly young kid, maybe 12 or 13, a friend of my mother was visting our house and upon realizing that I read the same type of books as him, offered to trade his set of books by David Eddings for my &amp;#8216;Deryni&amp;#8217; series by Katherine Kurtz.</description>

Brian Johnson has started a new column on Xbox.com aimed at parents &amp;#8230; parents who game with their kids&amp;#8230; parents whose kids play games&amp;#8230; and even just parents who play games (gaming is different for folks who have kids in the house!).

      <description>Ok, if you are a programmer&amp;#8230; or even if you just can relate enough that you think Office Space is one of the best movies in the world (doesn&amp;#8217;t everyone?) then I need you to do this:

Jonathan works on the Popular Science podcast, does music for John Hodgman&amp;#8217;s Little Gray Books, and used to be a programmer (although I don&amp;#8217;t think you ever stop being a programmer, you just decide to do something else with most of your time)</description>

For now, he has joined us over in the &amp;#8216;dev&amp;#8217; hallway, which I&amp;#8217;m sure he finds quite exciting&amp;#8230; maybe not as exciting as his Microsoft provided &amp;#8216;temp housing&amp;#8217;, but maybe it is close.
 &amp;#8220;My apartment is very nice, but the complex in which it is situated is a tad on the trashy side.</description>

      <description>Interesting news, content that is only for Xbox Live Gold members&amp;#8230; which even Tycho thinks is understandable, but I agree with his comments about what kind of content is being restricted.
 they made a serious misstep with the content they chose to inaugurate Silver&amp;#8217;s descent into squalor: a trailer for Gears of War. An advertisement. Now, don&amp;#8217;t get me wrong. This is really quite a trailer. The term &amp;#8220;trailer&amp;#8221; may even be insufficient.</description>

 Stream WMV video from a Windows PC running Windows Media Player 11, Zune software, or Windows Media Connect. Play video from storage devices such as USB flash drives, Xbox 360 Memory Units, etc.</description>

Tina Wood, formerly of G4 and a host of our show on http://on10.net{.broken_link}, worked with Scott Finley (our cameraman extraordinaire) to produce a how-to video about shooting a standard interview/product demo&amp;#8230; and it rocks. It also happens to be entertaining. For bonus points, to prove you watched it all the way through, feel free to discuss Tina&amp;#8217;s favorite food in the comment section!</description>

      <description>Ok, so if I was dealing with a 360, I could just pick up the VGA output cable&amp;#8230; but for some reason, we never made one of those for the original Xbox. Now, I&amp;#8217;ve found&amp;nbsp;some companies that make reasonably priced converters from component video inputs to VGA (I&amp;#8217;ve found several in the unreasonable price range too) but either they are permantely out of stock&amp;#8230; or they look a little &amp;#8230; hmm&amp;#8230; how to say this, not like someone I&amp;#8217;d like to give my credit card to?</description>

      <description>Probably not the best plan in the world, but we sent Laura out with Pizza and a Premium Xbox 360 to try and win the hearts and minds of a line up of PS3 buyers at Target&amp;#8230; watch the video on 10 (download only right now)&amp;#8230; and maybe we&amp;#8217;ll do the same for the Wii?</description>

      <description>On the Zune, any picture on the device can be set as the background for all of the menus, providing a great way to customize the look of your Zune. The screen on your Zune is 240 pixels wide and 320 pixels high (holding it in &amp;#8216;portrait mode&amp;#8217;, with the navigation pad at the bottom), so that is the proportions you want to shoot for as a background, but if you are making your own background images, then there are few things you should be aware of.</description>

&amp;#8230;moments ago we flipped the switch and the service is now available for all U.S. Xbox Live members. No dashboard update needed…just sign in to Xbox Live, and head over to Marketplace, then Media and Entertainment. You can also hit it directly from the Media blade-&amp;gt;Video Marketplace. If you have any questions, hit this FAQ or this FAQ on the Xbox forums. It’s fitting that on the Xbox 360’s first birthday, it becomes the first gaming console in history to provide HD TV shows and movies directly to your gaming lair&amp;#8230;.</description>

 Pull video off of their Motorola HD DVR cable box onto XP/Vista? Hook up the DVR using Firewire to a Media Center Edition box?  I&amp;#8217;m currently using a IR Blaster and the standard definition outputs on the Motorola box to connect my cable box to my MCE 2005 XP box&amp;#8230; works, but the quality isn&amp;#8217;t great&amp;#8230; but then I found this guide to firewire connections</description>

      <description>I loved Microsoft Reader, I had a ton of .lit files on my Pocket PC and I would save Word docs out as Reader files so I could read them while travelling or even just at home away from my main machine. Other than email, Reader was the &amp;#8216;killer app&amp;#8217; for me on the Pocket PC. But Reader was never given the love it needed, the Reader plug-in wasn&amp;#8217;t available for some versions of Office (at least not right away), you couldn&amp;#8217;t find all that many downloads in .</description>

      <description>If you are following Zune news, then I&amp;#8217;m sure you&amp;#8217;ve seen this &amp;#8216;hack&amp;#8217; to let you see your Zune as a read-only hard drive.
There are additional steps to make it so you can write to your Zune, but it seems so odd that you do it by starting a sync (a long sync I guess) that I haven&amp;#8217;t tried it myself. I honestly haven&amp;#8217;t thought of any reason I&amp;#8217;d need to write to the device at this point either, but reading off of the Zune works fine and I&amp;#8217;ve&amp;nbsp;already&amp;nbsp;found it useful to snag some converted videos files that I&amp;#8217;d like to store on my PC instead of the originals.</description>

      <description>If you know me, or read my blog much, you&amp;#8217;ll probably gather that I&amp;#8217;ve fully bought into the WMA/WMV world. I&amp;#8217;ve always been a bit annoyed at the iPod model of things as well&amp;#8230; I mean, seriously, you can only use iTunes with iPods and iPods with iTunes&amp;#8230; talk about crazy&amp;#8230; people need choice, who wants to be locked into one music player or one music store?!?
Of course, I don&amp;#8217;t get to rant about that anymore, now that we are doing the exact same thing with Zune&amp;#8230; I don&amp;#8217;t like it any better just because we are doing it, but I&amp;#8217;ve decided that I must be in the minority and that most consumers must not really care about being locked into a single store/brand.</description>

      <description>My previous post&amp;nbsp;about the Nike+ system left me searching for a similar solution for non-iPod users&amp;#8230; without a lot of luck, but Mark let me know about http://www.sportsdo.net, which is very cool. This site/software uses any GPS enabled Windows Mobile device to produce some useful info about your activity (running, skiing, whatever). I&amp;#8217;m interested and I&amp;#8217;ll probably enjoy using it, but it isn&amp;#8217;t really going to compete with the Nike+ system for two reasons:&amp;nbsp;The first reason&amp;nbsp;is that GPS isn&amp;#8217;t a great solution for this type of use, especially for someone (me) who does at least half their runs on a treadmill&amp;#8230; (hmm&amp;#8230; the software seems to think I haven&amp;#8217;t moved&amp;#8230;), and secondly there is the question of the device.</description>

      <description>I stumbled upon the PSP Connect site a few weeks ago, and I&amp;#8217;ve been really enjoying it as a source of video for my Zune. This site, since it is aimed at the PSP, has a ton of great 320&amp;#215;240 MP4 content, including a lot of popular viral videos, movie trailers (of all the upcoming Sony movies for sure) and even ongoing series such as the &amp;#8216;Spartan&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;Borg&amp;#8216; series of machinima.</description>

      <description>I send myself email&amp;#8230; which sounds more pathetic than it is. I just use it as a way to hang onto links or notes to myself (do this, watch this, etc&amp;#8230;). I do it all the time. Every once in awhile though, right after I send something to myself I see the &amp;#8216;new mail&amp;#8217; pop up on my computer and I click on it wondering &amp;#8216;hey, what&amp;#8217;s that&amp;#8230;&amp;#8217;.

      <description>If you have digital cable from Comcast, including HD service, then go up into the 600&amp;#8217;s and try to find the new Universal HD channel. Repeats of shows like Firefly, Battlestar Galatica (new series, not old), The Equalizer, Knight Rider&amp;#8230; and tons more, all in HD.

      <description>Back in the summer I jumped back into fitness by signing up for the 20&amp;frasl;20 program at the Pro Club. 20&amp;frasl;20 is a serious weight loss program that involves both diet change (I&amp;#8217;d characterize it as South Beach in style) and five workouts a week (including three with a personal trainer). Well, it has been quite successful so far, bringing my weight down from around 189 to about 160 over the past 5 months, and it has had the side affect of getting me back into running.</description>

      <description>My son, Connor (6 years old), has been playing chess against me for the past year or so&amp;#8230; but not very often really, maybe one or two games a month at the most. A local chess club held a chess tournament on February 24th at a nearby elementary school and Connor thought that would be pretty cool, so he entered. I have to admit, I was pretty worried that this would turn him off of chess, because he was really set on winning a trophy.</description>

      <description>This keeps happening to me on Microsoft sites, and it really bugs me&amp;#8230;
 I go to view a product on one of our sites, Xbox.com and Zune.net most recently I click on some image to see a larger view&amp;#8230; I right-click on the image with the intent of saving it to my machine, only to get the standard Flash context menu (Zoom, etc&amp;#8230;)  I get the appeal of Flash, I really do&amp;#8230; but these pages are just a gallery of images with a back and next button.</description>

      <description>Microsoft Research TechFest &amp;#8211; Intro, DynaVis, and FastDash
_&amp;#8230; In this, the first video in what will be a series covering this event, we get a nice introduction to TechFest, some info about Microsoft Research (MSR), and two projects: DynaVis and FastDash.
When you watch this video, hopefully you get an idea of why I&amp;#8217;m so excited right now. Once I have the whole series online, you&amp;#8217;ll be able to see the amazing work being done in MSR &amp;#8211; and this only represents a few projects.</description>

      <description>Marshillboy from Zuneboards.com has posted a utility that lets you connect your Zune up to multiple PCs as if they were all the &amp;#8216;home&amp;#8217; PC. Personally I like the idea, although the main benefit for me would be if it didn&amp;#8217;t show any UI&amp;#8230; right now, the &amp;#8216;hack&amp;#8217; pops up its own dialog in place of the Zune one&amp;#8230; so I have to click &amp;#8216;Next&amp;#8217; either way. Why would I want that?</description>

      <description>from their site:
 The Breast Cancer 3-Day is a 60-mile walk over the course of three days. Net proceeds benefit Susan G. Komen for the Cure and the National Philanthropic Trust, funding important breast cancer research, education, screening, and treatment.
 Laura will be walking for 3-days, and I&amp;#8217;ll be hanging out with the kids&amp;#8230; we all must do our part 🙂
If you&amp;#8217;d like to donate to the cause, check out Laura&amp;#8217;s fundraising page where you can find out more info and/or sign up to donate whatever amount of money you feel comfortable with&amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>My wife is going to be in the 3-Day walk for Breast Cancer and I thought it might be useful to build a widget to display your donation info on a website. So if you are going to walk in the event, or if you know someone who is, then you might be interested in this.

      <description>I was interested, and I guess I still am, but I&amp;#8217;m not sure yet&amp;#8230;
For one, they seem to be WMV files&amp;#8230; protected with our standard DRM, but yet they don&amp;#8217;t use Windows Media Player to play them back? I&amp;#8217;m not sure why this is, but if they supported playback in a normal video player then I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure these videos would work through Media Center (and therefore my Xbox 360) without any hassle.</description>

      <description>Darn script removing code on AOL! One woman, Nicolle, has a blog with AOL, but it won&amp;#8217;t let her add script to any part of the UI&amp;#8230; or even into a post.
The only way I could think of to try to work out a way around the problem was to make myself an AOL screen name and then an AOL blog and try to do the customizing myself&amp;#8230; no go, they don&amp;#8217;t strip all script tags, but they only allow script tags that are pointing back at certain sites (such as AOL, I&amp;#8217;m assuming).</description>

      <description>On Wednesday, a new Xbox Live Arcade game from Rare will be hitting the Marketplace&amp;#8230; Jetpac Refueled. I have to say, from the moment we started shipping retro games onto the Xbox 360, this is what I&amp;#8217;ve been waiting for.
Not this game itself, I&amp;#8217;ve never heard of it before to be honest (but wikipedia delivers the goods as always), but I always figured that the retro games would be re-developed to take advantage of the 360&amp;#8217;s graphics and sound&amp;#8230; and this one has been.</description>

      <description>In September of last year I signed up for the 20&amp;frasl;20 program at the Pro Club, a 25 week weight-loss program that includes personal training, dietitian appointments and even group therapy (yay!). Well, I&amp;#8217;m pretty much wrapped up on the program, and a few weeks ago they had me in to take measurements and a photo&amp;#8230; they took a photo at the beginning as well, so we end up with the classic before and after comparision.</description>

      <description>I read an interesting and well researched article about treadmill running vs. outdoor running&amp;#8230; The 1% Incline Treadmill Myth, and I certainly agree with the conclusion that air resistance has little or no effect on a runner at relatively low speeds (compared to world-class runners that is). I do find running outside harder though, for a few reasons&amp;#8230; one is that the ground is generally less forgiving than the treadmills I use at the Pro Club, and two is that in my part of the world&amp;#8230; there is really no such thing as a &amp;#8216;flat&amp;#8217; course.</description>

Turns out the problem appears to be in our RDF block on our blog pages. On a page like this, the RDF block contains the following element:</description>

      <description>I own a lot of Xbox and Xbox 360 games&amp;#8230; some good, some bad&amp;#8230; but the hit/miss ratio is much better for all my 360 games, mostly because of game renting. Starting around the time the 360 launched, I signed up for Gamefly&amp;nbsp;and I&amp;#8217;ve alternated between the two and three game plans. It is definitely a good deal for me, I usually only rent my second tier list of games, ones that I think I&amp;#8217;ll like but I&amp;#8217;m not already positive I&amp;#8217;ll buy.</description>

      <description>My 2nd column is up on Xbox.com, covering the recent Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game.

To sum up, it is a pretty fun game for kids; I&amp;#8217;d compare it to a faster paced, less scary and complex version of Prince of Persia, which is a great game to be compared to.</description>

      <description>My twitter app uses a web service hosted on my site to get all the necessary Xbox Live info&amp;#8230;. way more than the twitter app actually uses. This is a SOAP API, located here:
http://duncanmackenzie.net/services/XboxInfo.asmx{.broken_link}
&amp;nbsp;
I know that some people prefer a more RESTful API though, so I also have another &amp;#8216;page&amp;#8217; that you can call with a straight GET request and just pass the gamertag in as a query string parameter:</description>

      <description>Ok, ok&amp;#8230;. so I should have built-in an auto-update, ClickOnce would have been easy enough&amp;#8230;. but anyway&amp;#8230;. I&amp;#8217;ve added many features to the Xbox to Twitter application, including support for only updating when the title being played changes, not showing popups and even a preview of what your twitter updates will look like once they are combined with your template.
To update, uninstall the client using your Control Panel then click on the install link{.</description>

      <description>A few people have emailed me or posted comments wondering how I grab the Xbox Info for the Twitter app and for my services.
It is not from scraping and it is not from any publicly available source. I joined the Xbox Community Developer Program (XCDP), which is an official program designed to support folks who are building community sites (forums, reviews, blogs, etc&amp;#8230;) around Xbox related topics.
Many folks who want Xbox info, are not working on a large site like the people in the XCDP, which is exactly why I created my service.</description>

      <description>Family Gaming with the K-6 Crowd
 With Father&amp;#8217;s Day coming up, I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking a lot about my own Dad and how I got into videogames as a kid. My parents, perhaps swayed by George Plimpton&amp;#8217;s television commercials, went out and bought an Intellivision for the family. It was to be a Christmas gift for all of us, not just for me and my brother. It was hooked up to the only TV in the house, right in the living room where we spent our evenings.</description>

      <description>We (the dev team behind Channel 9, Channel 10, Mix Online, and others&amp;#8230;)been doing scrum-ish development for a few sprints now, but we recently switched to using eScrum. This is a set of templates and tools for use with Team Foundation Server and it really rocks. There are few less-than-polished elements about the install and the web interface, but I&amp;#8217;m glad they shipped it out for general use.
You can read a good summary of eScrum on the blog &amp;#8216;A Developer&amp;#8217;s Life&amp;#8217;, which is also a good resource for lots of other Visual Studio related news.</description>

      <description>Hey folks, I work as the dev lead for Channel 9, Channel 10, Mix Online and other sites. We build community sites for Microsoft using video, audio and text blogging and we build them using the latest .NET technologies. If you are into web development, if you have a passion for design and user experience, and if you really rock at AJAX, Javascript, CSS, C# and ASP.NET &amp;#8230;. then this is the job for you 🙂</description>

      <description>I was a bit surprised to find that I enjoyed this game, although I enjoyed the last few books in the series and the latest movie, I really figured the game would only appeal to kids. The pace is slower than most adult/teen games, but that makes it into more of an exploration instead of just quickly moving from one task to the next. My wife watched it and thought it was similar to a much more interactive and complex form of the game Myst&amp;#8230; there are some action elements where you have to move quickly, target the bad guys, etc&amp;#8230; but for the most part you are figuring out puzzles, perfecting your spells and exploring a very open set of environments.</description>

      <description>Saw this today (it is over a year old though) on Roger Hartford&amp;#8217;s blog;
 XSLT alternating rows In an XSLT template tag you can simulate the same functionality as in&amp;nbsp; GridView/DataGrid &amp;#8220;AlternatingRowClass&amp;#8221; property using this syntax:
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; AnotherClass/xsl:attribute
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; /xsl:if

It&amp;#8217;s that simple!
Roger
 I&amp;#8217;m a big fan of XSLT based processing&amp;#8230; and it is great to see ways to get exactly the results you want without additional server or client side code&amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>In the new code that we are building for Channel 9, we have a few HTML popups here and there&amp;#8230; floating divs for user info being one example. At the same time as we&amp;#8217;ve been adding that feature, we also moved from using Windows Media Player to using Silverlight as our video player.
We ran into a bit of an issue though, in that our floating HTML was sitting under the Silverlight player, no matter what I did with the z-index of the two areas of the page.</description>

      <description>When I started on the C9 dev team, one of the first things I did was to remove the ability for users to post embed, object and script tags. We had a couple of people abusing this feature and I wanted to lock it right down. The downside to this move was that it prevented some forms of user interaction/posts that we didn&amp;#8217;t really mind and in some cases would even like to encourage.</description>

      <description>Continuing on in the same pattern as my last post, adding Soapbox support to C9&amp;#8217;s forums, Adam Kinney bugged me a bit and I went ahead and added support for Silverlight Streaming as well.

It will be interesting to see if (or more accurately, how long before)&amp;nbsp;someone turns this to malicious purposes.</description>

      <description>A few of my friends and co-workers have jumped on the FeedBurner bandwagon, and I&amp;#8217;ve been pretty impressed with the stats they&amp;#8217;ve been gathering. I&amp;#8217;m not willing to send my readers off to someone else&amp;#8217;s service though (even though there are some reasonably safe ways to do that), so I started to think about how best to gather similar info myself. One idea would be to ship the IIS logs from my site back to my PC on a regular basis and run them through a LogParser script that would figure out all the stats for me&amp;#8230; but that seems like a rather manual (or difficult to automate) and data transfer intensive method.</description>

      <description>We used&amp;nbsp;a modified version of one of the templates that ships with Expression Media Encoder as our player&amp;#8230; and channel 8 has become the first of our sites (which include Channel 9, Channel 10, VisitMix.com and more) to have a Silverlight video player on them. And, below here, you can see that player embedded into this blog post&amp;#8230;
Note that I had to remove the &amp;#8216;scrubbing bar&amp;#8217; due to some&amp;nbsp;odd bug around&amp;nbsp;releasing the mouse after scrubbing was completed&amp;#8230; but we&amp;#8217;ll figure&amp;nbsp;that out and get it back in as soon as we can.</description>

      <description>For the price of $280, you can now get a new edition of the Xbox 360 console. This one is similar to the original core system, but with HDMI output, a 256mb memory card (so you can play and save your games right out of the box), a wireless controller,&amp;nbsp;and five full arcade games. Perfect if you are more of a casual gamer or if:
 you have an existing 360 with a hard drive and would like one with a HDMI output you need a DVD player&amp;nbsp;and/or a&amp;nbsp;Media Center Extender (play all your Zune and Windows Media Center or Windows Media Player content in the living room!</description>

      <description>In Halo 3 multi-player you can customize your SPARTAN or Elite&amp;#8217;s armor, with different variations unlocked by various achievements/activities in game (including one that can only be unlocked by being a Bungie employee). You can find out more about the different variations here, but it turns out that your profile on Bungie.net knows what choices you&amp;#8217;ve made and displays your current armor configuration on the web site.
If you go to the Halo 3 Model Generator though, created by a community member, you can find the picture of any particular gamer you&amp;#8217;d like (including yourself, which is how I found my picture, below) or create a custom image to plan out your own armor customizations.</description>

      <description>If you or your kids are all excited about the upcoming Bee Movie with Jerry Seinfeld, then you should definitely check out my latest article on Xbox.com. Along with the movie, an Xbox 360 game is also on its way&amp;#8230;. and a demo is already up on the Xbox Live Marketplace. Not the most representative demo (more on that in the article!), but still fun and the game promises even more.</description>

      <description>One of their users emailed us to comment on our video quality&amp;#8230; essentially pointing out that it sucked when viewed through their TV using TV Tonic. Well I was puzzled because, while we don&amp;#8217;t ship out DVD quality video, our high quality download is quite good for a podcast. Turns out though, after installing TV Tonic and picking on10.net out of their catalog, that the feed they have in their system is our 512kbps WMV feed&amp;#8230; which is certainly not the best quality around, around 430kbps for video and 320&amp;#215;240&amp;#8230; fine for display on our site, but not the hottest around&amp;#8230; instead they should be using our WMV (high quality) feed (2500 kbps, 640 x 480), but I have no idea how to tell them about it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve obviously been busy, I never even posted a link to these articles here&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;ve written two new Xbox Dad article in the past few weeks, one all about Xbox Live (to coincide with the Xbox Live is Five event going on) and one that I wrote this week about Viva Piñata Party Animals.
Viva Piñata Party is a great game, the &amp;#8216;party&amp;#8217; nature of it means that it is quick to get started, even for non-gamers, and the quick little matches means that you can pick it up and play even if you only have a little bit of time available.</description>

      <description>and the Group Manager of Platform Evangelism at Adobe feels the need to comment about it.
Let me summarize. Ice Cube is involved in an Internet video project and has chosen to use Silverlight{.broken_link}, and you can watch an interview with him about it in Silverlight. (on a side note, I decided not to include the video into my post, even though the instructions to do so are right there in the original blog entry, because it is set to auto-start when someone visits the page and I think that is just downright rude 🙂 )</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m very excited about it&amp;#8230; really! I just got distracted on http://sitemaps.org and ended up building a site map for this site{.broken_link}&amp;#8230; real brute force, just grabbed all the blog entries and tags and output the appropriate absolute paths into some objects that I then wrote out into an XML document. Same method wouldn&amp;#8217;t work on Channel 9 though, it has too many entries, so I&amp;#8217;ll need to move to a site map index with multiple sub site maps&amp;#8230; now I just have to figure out how to divide the entries up (by tag, by type of content, by date?</description>

One of the changes in that new code base was a move to an AJAX style interface for viewing lists of posts on the page.</description>

      <description>The auto inclusion of all our CSS files has finally become too annoying. We&amp;#8217;ll still use the app_theme directory, as it is a handy way to store our stuff&amp;#8230; but I&amp;#8217;m really hoping to not set the theme, and to add the appropriate CSS for the situation (mobile vs desktop for example) while also combining our CSS files and &amp;#8216;minifying&amp;#8217; them all through a simple &amp;#8216;css.ashx&amp;#8217; style handler. This should make it easier to do that combining at run time, while leaving them nice and separate for debug and development purposes.</description>

&amp;nbsp;
Windows cannot find &amp;#8216;C:\projects\9\web.config&amp;#8217;. Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again.
[OK]
&amp;nbsp;
VS 2008 opens, but no file. If I then pick the file from File | Open it works fine&amp;#8230; what the hell? As far as I can remember, this was true with VS 2005 and it has annoyed me every day&amp;#8230;</description>

A quick search and I found a great discussion of the viewport meta tag on furbo.org (the apple developer site provides the same info in a more reference format{.broken_link}). Turns out this simple meta tag helps Mobile Safari determine how best to scale your site for the smaller screen of the iPhone (relative to a desktop that is).</description>

      <description>I don&amp;#8217;t know if this is good or bad, but I thought it was neat that I could right-click the main project (excluding all our client script and HTML) that runs behind on10.net{.broken_link}, pick code metrics and see cool #s like &amp;#8220;23,442 lines of code&amp;#8221; 🙂
&amp;nbsp;
Lately though, I&amp;#8217;ve seen us reducing that number while adding features, so this might the highest result I&amp;#8217;ll ever see for this project 🙂</description>

      <description>We recently updated a few of our web sites with code that would provide a &amp;#8216;nicer&amp;#8217; experience for browsers that were not compatible with the ASP.NET ATLAS (AJAX) scripts we were using. For some reason though, a few users who were running a fully compatible browser (Firefox 2.0.0.*), were seeing the no-script experience. We were puzzled, but one of the users figured out that their ImageShack toolbar might be causing the problem.</description>

      <description>We recently had Donovan West (LiveGadgets.net) build us a set of sidebar gadgets for Windows Vista. These gadgets use the RSS feeds from each site and let you see all of our new content as it gets posted, then (using Silverlight) you can even play our videos right there on your desktop.

&amp;nbsp;
You can check out the gadgets (for Channel 9, Mix{.broken_link}, C8{.broken_link}, Edge{.broken_link}, and on10.net{.broken_link}) by clicking on the appropriate image below:</description>

      <description>If you&amp;#8217;ve written an app, private or public, using my data feed of Xbox live info{.broken_link} I&amp;#8217;d really appreciate it if you&amp;#8217;d let me know. This isn&amp;#8217;t a required &amp;#8216;sign-up&amp;#8217;, but I want to start to keep track so that I could possibly create a page listing all the sites using it, and it may also be useful to be able to contact folks if I need to make a change or take the service down for an hour or so.</description>

      <description>A new father-son activity for Connor and me has been to go to chess tournaments, spending a few Saturdays throughout the year in some school gym. Starting last year, we started to play chess at home and he enjoyed it so much that we decided to enter into the Shelton View Elementary school&amp;#8217;s chess tournament in the Kindergarten category. He did well and had a lot of fun, so it has become the hobby of choice around our house.</description>

      <description>Well, this certainly isn&amp;#8217;t something that happens all that often, but after spending all day at a chess tournament{.broken_link} (at Wellington Elementary in Woodinville) on Saturday, I ended up with a sunburn on my face and arms! It turned out to be a really nice day, which was good, since the waiting area for parents and kids (where the parents spend up about 6 to 7 hours, and the kids spend all the time between matches) was outside.</description>

      <description>It has been a crazy past few months for my health, or at least the appearance of my health.
For about 30-something years now, I’ve had problems with my tonsils. This has included one or more bouts per year of tonsillitis, quite a few cases of strep throat and a ton of colds that just seem to end up hitting me as sore throats and lasting way longer than it seems like they should.</description>

      <description>When I joined my current team, it was called the Channel 9 dev team, because Channel 9 was the big site that they had built and was the center of all of their efforts. You certainly wouldn’t have known that from how we spent the last two years though 🙂
We built a whole new code base for a video blog site and launched a new site (Channel 10) on that code, bringing some of the video style of Channel 9 to a new audience.</description>

      <description>One positive side to being stuck at home for two weeks is that I was able to do a fair bit more reading. For the most part, I read magazines and watched movies, but my wife also brought me the book &amp;ldquo;Three Cups of Tea&amp;rdquo; about Greg Mortenson&amp;rsquo;s work in Pakistan building schools for the children of poor rural areas. Mr. Mortenson, an avid mountain climber, ended up spending time in a small village near the base of K2 in Pakistan, barely making it down alive after a failed attempt to reach the summit.</description>

      <description>A month or so ago, I went looking to see if there was any way to read back issues of Marvel Comics online… and discovered a complete site around providing exactly that service{.broken_link}. With a subscription to the digital comics section, you can view any issue of any series that is available on their online catalog; I sat down a couple of nights ago and read through issues 1 to 100 of Ultimate Spiderman for example.</description>

 The flow there is pointless. It&amp;#8217;s like trying to make a baby by having sex with a rock. First, it&amp;#8217;s hard to get excited. And second, no baby.

I started out with overflow-x:auto &amp;#8230; which would add a scroll bar (at least in FF3), but then I went with white-space:pre-wrap; &amp;#8230; but IE doesn&amp;#8217;t like that 🙂

      <description>Erik pushed out a new release to Oxite today, the first since January 5th. This release is an important one, because it reflects a great deal of changes made in response to internal and external feedback about our initial release.
From the release notes:
 We made many [](http://www.codeplex.com/oxite/Wiki/View.aspx?title=architecture&amp;amp;referringTitle=Home){.externalLink}improvements, some based on community feedback, and added new features in this release:
 New Model, Services and Repositories Dependency Injection (Routes, Controllers, Services, Repositories, etc) ActionFilter Registry Better test coverage New validation class added Improved background services architecture Projects cleaned up and consolidated Views cleaned up No more *.</description>

      <description>Hey folks, many of you are familiar with the commotion that occurred around Oxite’s initial release. For various reasons, Oxite received a lot of attention from developers, bloggers and press… mostly because it is by Microsoft and it contained a lot of buzz-words that people care about (the two biggest being Open Source and CMS… and of course, the aforementioned ‘Microsoft’). This attention was a surprise to us, but it was mostly positive to start with so we were fairly happy.</description>

      <description>I really like to read. I read almost every night and I have since I was a little kid, so I’ve gone through a lot of books. Lately though I’ve noticed a new trend in my reading; I’m reading books that no one recommended to me. Well, no person recommended them to me, I guess it is all Amazon at this point.
Normally, and this goes back to the first time I read the Lord of the Rings, the Belgariad, or the many books of Piers Anthony, someone would mention the book to me and I’d go find it at the book store or the library and I’d be set.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago someone emailed Channel 9 looking for me, hoping to track down the source code for an old book of mine (Word 2000 VBA). At the time I couldn&amp;#8217;t imagine that I&amp;#8217;d be able to find it, but I found a set of archive CDs that I&amp;#8217;ve made over the years and voila, there it was.
Anyway, in the interest of feeding the internet search engine monster, the source code (in a zip) is attached to this post for anyone who might be looking for it.</description>

      <description>I’m only posting this because my son and I saw this commercial before a movie, loved it, and then for the life of me I couldn’t find it anywhere online. I was (seemingly logically) searching for &amp;#8220;Windows Phone Wedding”, sometimes adding Nokia 920… but no luck.
&amp;nbsp;
The actual You Tube video is entitled “Switch to the Nokia Lumia 920 Windows Phone” so I would guess my inclusion of “Wedding” was what was throwing off my search results 🙂</description>

      <description>And it is available in beta now, please check it out and let me know what you think.
&amp;nbsp;
So, here you go, if you have a Windows Phone 8 and have any interest in Channel 9 type content:
http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=9a5115e0-268a-4260-876c-dc0ff2f45c48
Just using the app generates telemetry that is useful, but please reply with any direct feedback you have to me and I’ll consolidate.
If you have a Channel 9 account, you can swipe over to the panel marked “More”, pick Settings and sign into your account.</description>

      <description>Back in the day, I used to write articles for MSDN, and I started up this column called “Coding 4 Fun” (the name lives on today along with some of the same spirit). The premise was that I would write about code I wrote for my own personal use. An app to sync photos from my computer to my mother’s so that she would get updates of the kid’s pictures. A remote control using my Pocket PC (yep, that was a while ago).</description>

      <description>Throughout the rest of the site, on twitter and through Google/Bing … the title of your post is the first and most important description of your content that people will see. With that in mind, here are a few tips to make the most of that space.
Length You should include enough in your title that it is a clear description of your content, but length is a factor. When we are indexed on Google, the full text is pulled from the  element of the page, but only the first x characters are visible in search results.</description>

      <description>My day job is running a bunch of systems as part of Microsoft’s evangelism group and the biggest of those is Channel 9 (https://channel9.msdn.com). Channel 9 is basically a video blogging platform. We have ‘blogs’, which contain posts, written by people. Seems simple enough, but after running for 10 years we have a bit of a problem. Too much content.
For years now, the problem of ‘how should we categorize our content?</description>
