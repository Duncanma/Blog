        I was telling the folks at work about this one yesterday, my wife and I had been watching the Daily Show when it came on and although we never watch commercials, we silently watched this entire one. We were very impressed&#8230; and then the Vista logo came up and we were stunned. Good work on this one, Vista Marketing Team ðŸ™‚

        I stumbled upon the PSP Connect site a few weeks ago, and I&#8217;ve been really enjoying it as a source of video for my Zune. This site, since it is aimed at the PSP, has a ton of great 320&#215;240 MP4 content, including a lot of popular viral videos, movie trailers (of all the upcoming Sony movies for sure) and even ongoing series such as the &#8216;Spartan&#8217; and &#8216;Borg&#8216; series of machinima.

        I send myself email&#8230; which sounds more pathetic than it is. I just use it as a way to hang onto links or notes to myself (do this, watch this, etc&#8230;). I do it all the time. Every once in awhile though, right after I send something to myself I see the &#8216;new mail&#8217; pop up on my computer and I click on it wondering &#8216;hey, what&#8217;s that&#8230;&#8217;. And then I feel silly.

        If you have digital cable from Comcast, including HD service, then go up into the 600&#8217;s and try to find the new Universal HD channel. Repeats of shows like Firefly, Battlestar Galatica (new series, not old), The Equalizer, Knight Rider&#8230; and tons more, all in HD. I watched an episode of Firefly last night in HD and it was wonderful!

        Back in the summer I jumped back into fitness by signing up for the 20&frasl;20 program at the Pro Club. 20&frasl;20 is a serious weight loss program that involves both diet change (I&#8217;d characterize it as South Beach in style) and five workouts a week (including three with a personal trainer). Well, it has been quite successful so far, bringing my weight down from around 189 to about 160 over the past 5 months, and it has had the side affect of getting me back into running.

        My son, Connor (6 years old), has been playing chess against me for the past year or so&#8230; but not very often really, maybe one or two games a month at the most. A local chess club held a chess tournament on February 24th at a nearby elementary school and Connor thought that would be pretty cool, so he entered. I have to admit, I was pretty worried that this would turn him off of chess, because he was really set on winning a trophy.

        This keeps happening to me on Microsoft sites, and it really bugs me&#8230;
 I go to view a product on one of our sites, Xbox.com and Zune.net most recently I click on some image to see a larger view&#8230; I right-click on the image with the intent of saving it to my machine, only to get the standard Flash context menu (Zoom, etc&#8230;)  I get the appeal of Flash, I really do&#8230; but these pages are just a gallery of images with a back and next button.

        Microsoft Research TechFest &#8211; Intro, DynaVis, and FastDash
_&#8230; In this, the first video in what will be a series covering this event, we get a nice introduction to TechFest, some info about Microsoft Research (MSR), and two projects: DynaVis and FastDash.
When you watch this video, hopefully you get an idea of why I&#8217;m so excited right now. Once I have the whole series online, you&#8217;ll be able to see the amazing work being done in MSR &#8211; and this only represents a few projects.

        I captured some footage of Viva PiÃ±ata to test the quality of capturing the analog video out from the 360 into a miniDV camera&#8230; worked out pretty good I think.
