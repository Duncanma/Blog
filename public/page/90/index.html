        I think it was playing Chargeball in Meet the Robinsons, but for whatever reason I started thinking about this

I loved the breaking glass sound when I broke an enemy&#8217;s disc or threw my disc through the recognizer&#8217;s eye&#8230; mmm&#8230;. good times ðŸ™‚

        Kent&#8217;s blog is back online and in one of his recent posts he updates us on all the projects he&#8217;s been working since he left Microsoft (where we were both working at MSDN as content strategists)&#8230; tons of cool stuff, definitely worth reading through and following some links.

        It seems like an online article, but I wonder if it wouldn&#8217;t be just easier for them to publish these articles as blog entries?

        I read an interesting and well researched article about treadmill running vs. outdoor running&#8230; The 1% Incline Treadmill Myth, and I certainly agree with the conclusion that air resistance has little or no effect on a runner at relatively low speeds (compared to world-class runners that is). I do find running outside harder though, for a few reasons&#8230; one is that the ground is generally less forgiving than the treadmills I use at the Pro Club, and two is that in my part of the world&#8230; there is really no such thing as a &#8216;flat&#8217; course.

        I recently noticed a bug in the trackback codeÂ on Channel 10, some sites were failing to send us trackbacks, even though we were receiving trackbacks from other sources and those sites were happily trackbacking (I&#8217;m just annoying the spell checker today) other blogs.
Turns out the problem appears to be in our RDF block on our blog pages. On a page like this, the RDF block contains the following element:

        I own a lot of Xbox and Xbox 360 games&#8230; some good, some bad&#8230; but the hit/miss ratio is much better for all my 360 games, mostly because of game renting. Starting around the time the 360 launched, I signed up for Gamefly&nbsp;and I&#8217;ve alternated between the two and three game plans. It is definitely a good deal for me, I usually only rent my second tier list of games, ones that I think I&#8217;ll like but I&#8217;m not already positive I&#8217;ll buy.

        My 2nd column is up on Xbox.com, covering the recent Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game.

To sum up, it is a pretty fun game for kids; I&#8217;d compare it to a faster paced, less scary and complex version of Prince of Persia, which is a great game to be compared to.
