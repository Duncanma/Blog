        Hey folks, I work as the dev lead for Channel 9, Channel 10, Mix Online and other sites. We build community sites for Microsoft using video, audio and text blogging and we build them using the latest .NET technologies. If you are into web development, if you have a passion for design and user experience, and if you really rock at AJAX, Javascript, CSS, C# and ASP.NET &#8230;. then this is the job for you ðŸ™‚

        Brian was in town a few days ago and we ended up at a local bookstore&#8230; of course, since Brian hadn&#8217;t even seen our new book, we looked around and found a copy&#8230; ðŸ™‚

        I was a bit surprised to find that I enjoyed this game, although I enjoyed the last few books in the series and the latest movie, I really figured the game would only appeal to kids. The pace is slower than most adult/teen games, but that makes it into more of an exploration instead of just quickly moving from one task to the next. My wife watched it and thought it was similar to a much more interactive and complex form of the game Myst&#8230; there are some action elements where you have to move quickly, target the bad guys, etc&#8230; but for the most part you are figuring out puzzles, perfecting your spells and exploring a very open set of environments.

        Saw this today (it is over a year old though) on Roger Hartford&#8217;s blog;
 XSLT alternating rows In an XSLT template tag you can simulate the same functionality as in&nbsp; GridView/DataGrid &#8220;AlternatingRowClass&#8221; property using this syntax:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AnotherClass/xsl:attribute
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /xsl:if

It&#8217;s that simple!
Roger
 I&#8217;m a big fan of XSLT based processing&#8230; and it is great to see ways to get exactly the results you want without additional server or client side code&#8230;

        In the new code that we are building for Channel 9, we have a few HTML popups here and there&#8230; floating divs for user info being one example. At the same time as we&#8217;ve been adding that feature, we also moved from using Windows Media Player to using Silverlight as our video player.
We ran into a bit of an issue though, in that our floating HTML was sitting under the Silverlight player, no matter what I did with the z-index of the two areas of the page.

        When I started on the C9 dev team, one of the first things I did was to remove the ability for users to post embed, object and script tags. We had a couple of people abusing this feature and I wanted to lock it right down. The downside to this move was that it prevented some forms of user interaction/posts that we didn&#8217;t really mind and in some cases would even like to encourage.

        Continuing on in the same pattern as my last post, adding Soapbox support to C9&#8217;s forums, Adam Kinney bugged me a bit and I went ahead and added support for Silverlight Streaming as well.

It will be interesting to see if (or more accurately, how long before)&nbsp;someone turns this to malicious purposes.

        A few of my friends and co-workers have jumped on the FeedBurner bandwagon, and I&#8217;ve been pretty impressed with the stats they&#8217;ve been gathering. I&#8217;m not willing to send my readers off to someone else&#8217;s service though (even though there are some reasonably safe ways to do that), so I started to think about how best to gather similar info myself. One idea would be to ship the IIS logs from my site back to my PC on a regular basis and run them through a LogParser script that would figure out all the stats for me&#8230; but that seems like a rather manual (or difficult to automate) and data transfer intensive method.

        We used&nbsp;a modified version of one of the templates that ships with Expression Media Encoder as our player&#8230; and channel 8 has become the first of our sites (which include Channel 9, Channel 10, VisitMix.com and more) to have a Silverlight video player on them. And, below here, you can see that player embedded into this blog post&#8230;
Note that I had to remove the &#8216;scrubbing bar&#8217; due to some&nbsp;odd bug around&nbsp;releasing the mouse after scrubbing was completed&#8230; but we&#8217;ll figure&nbsp;that out and get it back in as soon as we can.
