        A month or so ago, I went looking to see if there was any way to read back issues of Marvel Comics online‚Ä¶ and discovered a complete site around providing exactly that service{.broken_link}. With a subscription to the digital comics section, you can view any issue of any series that is available on their online catalog; I sat down a couple of nights ago and read through issues 1 to 100 of Ultimate Spiderman for example.

 The flow there is pointless. It&#8217;s like trying to make a baby by having sex with a rock. First, it&#8217;s hard to get excited. And second, no baby.

I started out with overflow-x:auto &#8230; which would add a scroll bar (at least in FF3), but then I went with white-space:pre-wrap; &#8230; but IE doesn&#8217;t like that üôÇ

Nathan, can you send me the link to those pre-wrap alternates?

        Erik pushed out a new release to Oxite today, the first since January 5th. This release is an important one, because it reflects a great deal of changes made in response to internal and external feedback about our initial release.
From the release notes:
 We made many [](http://www.codeplex.com/oxite/Wiki/View.aspx?title=architecture&amp;referringTitle=Home){.externalLink}improvements, some based on community feedback, and added new features in this release:
 New Model, Services and Repositories Dependency Injection (Routes, Controllers, Services, Repositories, etc) ActionFilter Registry Better test coverage New validation class added Improved background services architecture Projects cleaned up and consolidated Views cleaned up No more *.

        Hey folks, many of you are familiar with the commotion that occurred around Oxite‚Äôs initial release. For various reasons, Oxite received a lot of attention from developers, bloggers and press‚Ä¶ mostly because it is by Microsoft and it contained a lot of buzz-words that people care about (the two biggest being Open Source and CMS‚Ä¶ and of course, the aforementioned ‚ÄòMicrosoft‚Äô). This attention was a surprise to us, but it was mostly positive to start with so we were fairly happy.

        I really like to read. I read almost every night and I have since I was a little kid, so I‚Äôve gone through a lot of books. Lately though I‚Äôve noticed a new trend in my reading; I‚Äôm reading books that no one recommended to me. Well, no person recommended them to me, I guess it is all Amazon at this point.
Normally, and this goes back to the first time I read the Lord of the Rings, the Belgariad, or the many books of Piers Anthony, someone would mention the book to me and I‚Äôd go find it at the book store or the library and I‚Äôd be set.

        A few weeks ago someone emailed Channel 9 looking for me, hoping to track down the source code for an old book of mine (Word 2000 VBA). At the time I couldn&#8217;t imagine that I&#8217;d be able to find it, but I found a set of archive CDs that I&#8217;ve made over the years and voila, there it was.
Anyway, in the interest of feeding the internet search engine monster, the source code (in a zip) is attached to this post for anyone who might be looking for it.

        I‚Äôm only posting this because my son and I saw this commercial before a movie, loved it, and then for the life of me I couldn‚Äôt find it anywhere online. I was (seemingly logically) searching for &#8220;Windows Phone Wedding‚Äù, sometimes adding Nokia 920‚Ä¶ but no luck.
&nbsp;
The actual You Tube video is entitled ‚ÄúSwitch to the Nokia Lumia 920 Windows Phone‚Äù so I would guess my inclusion of ‚ÄúWedding‚Äù was what was throwing off my search results üôÇ

        And it is available in beta now, please check it out and let me know what you think.

So, here you go, if you have a Windows Phone 8 and have any interest in Channel 9 type content:
http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=9a5115e0-268a-4260-876c-dc0ff2f45c48
Just using the app generates telemetry that is useful, but please reply with any direct feedback you have to me and I‚Äôll consolidate.
If you have a Channel 9 account, you can swipe over to the panel marked ‚ÄúMore‚Äù, pick Settings and sign into your account.

        Back in the day, I used to write articles for MSDN, and I started up this column called ‚ÄúCoding 4 Fun‚Äù (the name lives on today along with some of the same spirit). The premise was that I would write about code I wrote for my own personal use. An app to sync photos from my computer to my mother‚Äôs so that she would get updates of the kid‚Äôs pictures. A remote control using my Pocket PC (yep, that was a while ago).
