        Brian and I were chatting (arguing actually) about the PSP the other day at lunch&#8230; I thought the idea of selling movies for the device, movies that you couldn&#8217;t use in a DVD player at home, was crazy and Brian didn&#8217;t. Brian&#8217;s opinion is likely the more accurate one (it usually is), these PSP movies will probably sell, definitely at airports and for rentals and probably in less volume for normal use&#8230;

        Lately I&#8217;ve been luckily enough to be able to reuse several bits of code I&#8217;ve written in Visual Basic 2002 and 2003, namely code from a few of my earlier MSDN articles (Design Surface and the Control series). Since I was planning to make a few changes, I pulled these projects into Visual Basic 2005 Beta 1 (instead of just referencing the already existing assemblies created with the .NET Framework 1.

        In my first post on this site, I mentioned an application that I wrote to copy blog posts from one .Text server to another. Overall, I didn&#8217;t think the application had any real use after the web service I used was removed from the weblogs.asp.net servers, but I&#8217;m posting it anyway for anyone who might find it useful.

I kinda missed this launch, but it has been in the works for quite some time so I had an idea that it was on its way&#8230; check out Jay&#8217;s blog{.broken_link} for all the details.

        And I&#8217;m not trying to be casual&#8230; stupid thing is, I went for a run on Monday as part of a &#8220;Boot Camp&#8221; group fitness program, and it was probably my longest run in the last 12 years&#8230; and now my foot is just killing me when I put on my normal shoes. Turns out, when I put my running shoes back on it feels fine, but I&#8217;m not a fan of wearing running shoes with my regular work clothes so I went all out today and put on track pants and a T-shirt (along with my comfortable shoes, of course).

        There is even an accompanying article. Oh, and a challenge:   The first person that can send me a history file that shows the gameplay getting to 1 piece left (with the default 8x8x2 game), I&#8217;ll happily annouce it to the world (at least the readers of this site). Do you have what it takes? If you think you do; let the challenge begin.

        That may not seem like a big deal to most MIcrosoft developers, since most of them write code for that exact purpose, but I have spent most of my time in Redmond writing sample code and even with my switch to development I&#8217;m focused on writing internal systems that are not likely to ever be exposed outside of our own users. Recently, the Tablet PC folks released the &#8220;Experience Pack for Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005{.

        Scott Seely, a former MSDN co-worker of mine and now a member of the Indigo team, is working on a new Indigo book with Brian Nantz. The book won&#8217;t be out for a while, but you can get a lot of advance information (including some of the chapters), by watching for updates on www.thatindigobook.com. Should be a great way to get a free taste of some Indigo content right from someone who works on the code&#8230;

        Of course, the iPod has been available (and widely publicized) through these free sites for a while (shuffle, regular/mini, or photo model all have their own sites), but if you are like me and you want to use a media player that works with more than one brand of device, or if you want to stick with WMA (I have ripped 15 GB of my music into that format, and it works great with my Rio Nitrus and wife&#8217;s Rio Cali&#8230; so I&#8217;m sticking there for the forseeable future!
