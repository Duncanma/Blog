        Woo Hoo, I got a bag when I registered! Lately, I haven&#8217;t been getting them, something about the &#8220;staff&#8221; on my registration at all of these things&#8230; so my laptop bag closet was getting a little empty. I give these great bags away to my friends and family, there are just too many for one person, which is why you might see my mother roaming around with a TechEd bag, or see my wife at the park with my son and a nice VSLive &#8220;tote&#8221;!

        I thought I had better write my first TechEd related post, now that I&#8217;ve joined techedbloggers.net, and especially since I&#8217;ve arrived in Dallas.
Nothing much to report except a minor complaint; the Hyatt Regency doesn&#8217;t have high-speed Internet&#8230; and that is a bit of a disappointment. Yeah, yeah, I know&#8230; boo-hoo, no high-speed Internet, poor Microsoft guy. But really&#8230; there are a ton of TechEd attendees here, it looks like we&#8217;ve filled up the place, so I think it would have been handy for a lot of people&#8230; although I&#8217;m mostly just concerned about me at the moment, it just sounds better if I say I&#8217;m worried about all the other attendees.

        A pair of Mr. Smiths (Eric and Cory) have invited me and anyone else who is into .NET to come for dinner and drinks at the Hard Rock Cafe in Dallas&#8230; 7 pm Tuesday night.
I&#8217;ll be there, and I hope to see a few more folks too!

        Skipped out of work on Friday morning to go sea Finding Nemo with my son. He is only 2yrs old, so he probably isn’t really ready for going to movies as a general practice… but he really enjoyed it. About a month ago I was in Las Vegas and I brought him home a “Nemo” plush fish… I explained that in a month (which is a longer period of time than he can really grasp, but he knew it was “soon, but not now”) he and I would go to a movie with Nemo in it.

        My latest column is up on MSDN, 
[
Macro Madness
](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun05302003.asp)
, part of the ongoing Coding 4 Fun experience!
Speaking of Coding 4 Fun, or the lack thereof&#8230; I&#8217;m sitting in a wireless lounge at TechEd, where I have spent most of my trip to Dallas&#8230; doing remote troubleshooting and coding on a system back in Redmond. Not a unique experience, I&#8217;m sure many of the people reading this entry have ended up working from a remote location when they expected to attend sessions or other activities&#8230; but still not the best way to spend one&#8217;s time.

        Ed Kaim{.broken_link} appears to &#8220;like&#8221; our new Developer Center format&#8230;
I especially like his architecture model.

        The new ASP.NET developer center has launched at http://msdn.microsoft.com/asp.net. And yes, having asp.net as a directory name is perfectly &#8220;legal&#8221;, even if it looks a little odd the first time you see it.

        I&#8217;m sure Alan Cooper has a better name for it, but this thread{.broken_link} on GDN{.broken_link} caught my eye today;
Question: I want to make sure that the txtBox is Numeric Only on &#8220;Leave&#8221;. I&#8217;m sure a user will at eventually enter a $ into the txtBox. I want to bring up a MessageBox on &#8220;Leave&#8221; that will notify the user to take the $ of the txtBox and prevent further data entry until the $ is removed.

        Jamie Cool took the auto-updating technology out of Terrarium{.broken_link} and made it into its own component solution for adding application updates to your app{.broken_link}, which was pretty cool on its own&#8230; but now it is even cooler as PAG (the same MSFT group who brought you the Data Access Application Block, etc.) has taken Jamie&#8217;s code and updated it with a whole host of new features including support for background copying using BITS{.

        I&#8217;m on my way to Winnipeg, Manitoba to give a talk on No Touch Deployment with .NET; luckily I managed to find wireless access at the Vancouver airport along the way. If I had to pick one thing about .NET that justifies a move from VB6 windows applications to VB.NET Windows Forms it would have to be the ease of deployment and update using the Internet. Check out this article for more info on the whole concept of No Touch Deployment{.
