        Don&#8217;t misunderstand, I enjoyed the book{.broken_link}&#8230; but just like watching an episode of your favorite TV show and knowing that it will be another week until you can see another (or watching the Pegasus episode of Battlestar Galactica, knowing that it will be months before you see the conclusion of that story), I&#8217;m always sad to see it end.
I put off reading the book at all for quite some time, figuring that once I started I would neglect other responsibilities (including some sleep) until it was done, and I also thought that it would be good to go back and re-read #10, so that the story flowed better for me.

        I&#8217;ve been trying to fix some XHTML issues on my blog, but two pieces of technology are thwarting my plans&#8230;. first, there is the text editor in .Text (FreeTextBox) which appears to be making the first anchor or image tag in the post uppercase, even though I have its XHTML support enabled&#8230; (so my first link is , instead of ) and the second is the ASP.NET Calendar (1.1 framework version).

        In the end, MSDN didn&#8217;t end up needing the RSS editor I wrote, so I&#8217;ve stripped out the features and content specific to their needs and started turning it into a more generic RSS creation tool. If you&#8217;d like to see it, as it is, you can run it from a ClickOnce install point here on my site. There are more features coming, and I&#8217;m revamping the style and behavior of the category system&#8230;.

        Matthew mentions in response to an earlier post that my site might be broken for people using the IE 7 Beta &#8230; I don&#8217;t have IE 7 installed, because I thought I should really be testing any of my work projects in IE 6 (along with Firefox and Opera), but if anyone else has it on their machine, could you let me know if you run into any problems? Contact me through the blog, or email IE7Issues@duncanmackenzie.

        I&#8217;ve been working on some feed support in MSDN&#8217;s new online platform (a beta of which is running http://msdn2.microsoft.com) and I had to decide what content-type to use when outputting a RSS feed. I knew this was a contentious issue in the past, but I thought it might have been resolved so I did some browsing of specs and discussions and ended up with the following links:
 A discussion on Sam Ruby&#8217;s blog around content-type (the comments are the interesting part) This post by Dave Winer  I&#8217;m sure I could find more, but it appears this was never really resolved&#8230; using application/xml seems the most &#8216;proper&#8217;, but the concern is that some browsers don&#8217;t know how to handle it &#8230; so the other choice is text/xml (specifically text/xml; charset=utf-8 or else the charset will default to US-ASCII).

        I&#8217;ve been working (as part of a large team!) on the new platform for MSDN, which is up and running at http://msdn2.microsoft.com&#8230; and now you can see prototype versions of the MSDN home page ontop of that same platform. Check it out here [http://beta.msdn.microsoft.com/default.aspx]. The new home page demonstrates some of the personalization/profile features that will end up on the final MSDN site in the near future.

        I&#8217;ve recently accepted a job with the Channel 9 team (working for Jeff and working with Adam, Erik, Robert, and Charles), and &#8230; because I&#8217;m mostly a one-job kind of guy, that means I have to stop working at MSDN. So, come January 16th, I&#8217;ll be over in a new office at Channel 9, probably not coding anything yet as it always take a few days to get ramped up, connected to the right source trees, etc&#8230;
