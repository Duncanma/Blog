        I don&#8217;t know if it is just me, but there are some times when a new product comes out and they have me from the moment I see the ad; the price is right, the features are exactly what I am looking for, etc&#8230;
Well, that happened this weekend&#8230; I have been pondering on getting a progressive scan DVD player for some time, and I had been stuck on a few things;

        Kent recently wrote an ASP.NET control (ascx) to display the contents of an RSS feed onto a web page (for use on MSDN) so I decided to slap it on my own web site to display blogs entries at http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/blog/default.aspx{.broken_link}, and I think it looks pretty good!

        If you found a (really) cool download on MSDN, but it was 200+ mb, would you want it packaged for download as a single file, or as multiple .cabs (maybe 10-20 mb each?)
Of course, this isn&#8217;t just hypothetical, but details on what the download is will follow in a few days!
Post comments if you have the time!
Thanks!

        Wow! Thanks for all the comments (you can stop now), I think I have a pretty good idea what you folks think.
Just FYI, disk space is not an issue at all&#8230; it is testing that is the issue, we are going to sign this download and put it up in 2 days&#8230; our test team would need to do another complete test pass on a multi-file download (it is one now) since it truly is different bits&#8230; and we don&#8217;t have enough time for that!

        Was it fate, or mere coincidence? Today, I checked out a little online message board where MSFT employees sell/trade various used items (computers, appliances, furniture, baby clothes&#8230; whatever) and someone was selling one of those new Samsung DVD players with DVI out&#8230; yep, the very same one that I decided to buy, and then changed my mind{.broken_link} after seeing the price of the DVI cables&#8230;
It was around a month old and $100 off retail price&#8230; so I bought it.

        We&#8217;ve updated the page with the download URL already (some fast work on the part of our site team there), so you might want to go back and check it out&#8230;
http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/vbrkit/{.broken_link}
If you aren&#8217;t already using some form of download manager, I&#8217;d like to humbly suggest you try out my app from http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/using/columns/code4fun/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun02282003.asp{.broken_link}
It won&#8217;t pull it down amazingly fast (it tries to avoid using up a lot of your CPU and bandwidth if you are using the machine) but it will retry and retry even across restarts&#8230; just fire up the app again to check status.

        The download isn&#8217;t up yet, it takes some time to sign and virus scan an entire CD packaged up as a zip, but the site that details what is included is there!
Check out http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/vbrkit for all the details, and you can even order yourself a copy of the CD if you want to avoid the downloading hassles&#8230;
Quick highlights; a ton of free controls (not just trial editions) from Component One, Dundas, Infragistics, and Sax (Sax has provided a serial communication control!

        When you are creating a SQL script to deploy your system, Enterprise Manager does a good job with all of the schema (creating the tables, views, etc&#8230;) but doesn&#8217;t handle creating INSERTS for any of your lookup tables. I used to generate SQL INSERT statements for my data using a SELECT (SELECT &#8216;INSERT &#8230;&#8221;&#8216; + [Col1] +&rsquo;&#8221;&#8230;), but looking around on the web tonight, I found a cool stored proc that does all the work for you.

        I haven&#8217;t tried this out myself, but Mark Hurd posted a useful comment to my VB Resource Kit post&#8230;
 re: Visual Basic Resource Kit Download Available 10/3/2003 6:45 PM Mark Hurd
Downloaded and installed the RK on a machine with enough free disk and .NET 1.1.
No errors were displayed by the installer, but there was a &#8220;page not found&#8221; IE Window showing&#8230;
To save everyone else&#8217;s time: URLScan, as installed by W2k SP4, has a default setting that bars URLs with dots in the path (except for the extension)!
