        Anytime people talk about developing shareware with .NET, the discussion centers around the download/install of the Framework, because that is the issue that seems like the biggest hurdle to non-corporate developers&#8230; I could go on and on about the various methods of getting the Framework installed in 1.1 and in 2.0, but I like what Nick posted to the forum;
 &#8230;your audience will judge your app based only on the advantages it offers, its price, ease of use and generally things that are used as criteria for every other app, .

        I noticed the cool ads rotating on the side of&nbsp;the developer centers (VB and C#) so I “Viewed Source” and grabbed the relevant HTML&#8230; voila, I&#8217;m now showing MSN Ads on my site&#8230; totally inappropriate? Perhaps, but very easy&#8230;

        Shawn, my boss, recommends this AW book by Rebecca Riordan, which is one of the few .NET books I&#8217;ve found time to read lately, and I have to agree&#8230; I have doubts on whether or not it will sell as many copies as it should, as people seem to cluster around very focused books even when this book is exactly what they need, but it certainly deserves to be successful.

        I was staring at my bandwidth usage tonight and it is quite high&#8230;. and thanks to this cool SVG based stats system that easerve provides, I can drill down and figure out which pages are causing the bulk of that traffic&#8230; well, the biggest offenders for # of hits were the aggBugs that .Text includes (because my blog posts, including the aggbugs, are shown on MSDN, and therefore generate 3 aggBug requests for every single view of the Visual Basic or C# Developer Center pages), but the biggest use of bandwidth was by far the mainfeed.

        I was reading an entry from David Kean about some inconsistencies in 2.0 Framework classes, and I decided to jump up a level and read through some of his others posts&#8230; holy code samples, Batman! Seriously, almost every post includes a code or XML sample of some sort&#8230; that is a high signal-to-noise ratio folks&#8230; all on fairly interesting .NET topics, including quite a few discussions of FxCop&#8230; you should definitely check this blog out (link below)&#8230;.

        Juanito27 posted this question to the VB.NET forum on GotDotNet last week&#8230;
 Command line compile Windows vb app
I need to have someone show me how to compile via command line a vb.net windows app. Could someone show me the minimum code to get a window/form up with maybe a label or button on it.
 so I posted up a sample to the samples page on my personal site that shows creating two programs via the VB.

        My Advanced Basics column from the October 2004 issue is now up online&#8230;
 Building a Progress Bar that Doesn&#8217;t Progress
 and if you think that title is odd, here is what Chris Sells had to say when he first heard it&#8230; (comments used 100% without permission, but I figure he won&#8217;t mind)&#8230;
 &#8220;I can’t wait to read &#8216;Building a Progress Bar that Doesn&#8217;t Progress.&#8217; I assume follow on articles will cover &#8216;Building a Button that Doesn&#8217;t Butt&#8217; and &#8216;Building a Status Bar that Doesn&#8217;t Stat?

        &#8220;Dynamic Systems&#8221; recently submitted a suggestion into the MSDN Product Feedback system, looking for a way to add a shortcut (link to their app) to the user&#8217;s desktop, startup folder or other location&#8230;. well, I don&#8217;t have a built-in .NET Framework answer for that, but there is a relevant Code Project article available&#8230;

        I&#8217;ve recently signed up for NetFlix, but earlier I had tried out GameFly, a service I like to think of as &#8220;NetFlix for Games&#8221;&#8230; and I remembered that I had planned to describe my experience on my blog at some point, but I had never gotten around to it!
Basically Gamefly is the same deal as NetFlix. You fill up a queue with games you want, they send you the first 3, then send you the next whenever you return one of the ones you have.

        As part of the United Way&#8217;s Day of Caring, I went into Seattle today and did some work for a non-profit counseling center&#8230; specifically creating an Access system for them&#8230;. a few tables, 3 forms, and a bunch of analysis queries and reports all around stats&#8230;
Great stuff&#8230;. helping out a non-profit, but it was my first time building anything in Access in ages&#8230;. I used to do it all the time as part of past jobs, etc&#8230;.
