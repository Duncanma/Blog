        My last two posts mentioned two different ways of achieving similar results; deploying and updating an application over the Internet. Not suprisingly, I received a comment asking how do you determine which of the two methods to use, a very good question which I will try to answer here.
The first thing to understand is that, while the two methods have similar goals, they are different in a key respect; one deploys over the network when you run it, the other uses the network to retrieve updates.

        My most recent Coding 4 Fun column was just published&#8230; a fairly &#8220;fun&#8221; example, even if it happens to do something a little &#8216;odd&#8217; with Remoting over SOAP. For those of you who read it; using Add Web Reference on the .NET Compact Framework side of things to connect to a Remoting server is not the recommended way to do things, but it does work in some situations and &#8230; well&#8230; it is pretty darn easy, so I went with it.

        Is now up on the web (I guess it was all up there before, just not in one place) as my interview with mainfunction.com has made it up onto their web site. I think they told me this was coming months ago, so I hope I didn&#8217;t mention it to a bunch of people then, because I&#8217;m betting it was only published recently.

        I just uploaded a new sample to microsoft.com, pulling some useful code out of another MSDN sample that was so unrelated that I figured that this little bit of interesting code would never be found. This code sample shows how to retrieve the icon for any given file type and it does it through a pretty cool component that exposes 2 ImageLists to make it easy to use with a ListView or TreeView.

        I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve worked with more disorganized and unprofessional companies, although I can&#8217;t think of any, but I certainly haven&#8217;t continued to work with them&#8230; but I&#8217;m fairly stuck with Verizon.
I just moved into a new house, only a few minutes away from my apartment, and I called Verizon to arrange for the move of the phone and DSL (both through them). They were very nice on the phone and arranged to move both as of the 3rd of July&#8230; although they had to transfer me to a 2nd person to arrange the DSL, because it seems they are essentially two different companies.

        As a parent of a 2yr old, I don&#8217;t get out to see bands as often as I used to (I know it is certainly possible, but we are not really connected into a babysitting network, so we only go out when family is visiting)&#8230; but it turns out that all you need is a toddler and to live in the right city.
I went out to University Village on the weekend to hang out, buy a book on grilling (new house has me out on the patio a bit more than usual), get some Ben and Jerry&#8217;s ice cream&#8230; and I ended up spending an hour in a little playground in the middle of the place.

        As some folks may know, I{.broken_link} come up with the content for the Visual Basic developer center on MSDN (http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic) and I&#8217;m going to list some blogs on a sub-page of the site&#8230; starting with a small list, but hopefully growing it with some feedback from the community at large. I&#8217;m interested in blogs that contain useful information for Visual Basic (.NET or not) developers. I was going to start with:

        &#8220;anon&#8221; (why not leave a name, it is much more fun) posted a comment in response to my previous entry{.broken_link}, asking why am I including Brad Abrams and Chris Brumme&#8230; as they are not VB-specific&#8230;
Perhaps I need to be clearer about my intent.
&#8220;I&#8217;m interested in blogs that contain useful information for Visual Basic (.NET or not) developers.&#8221; &#8230; the fact that Brad Abrams and Chris Brumme are not tied to any one language is the whole reason why I chose to list them.
