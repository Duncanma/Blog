        A few people have emailed to let me know about the various &#8216;conga lines&#8217; out there, for people interested in the referral based offers discussed in my previous post. One source for these, that I know of, is a forum on GearLive that lists a few different ones.
I guess it isn&#8217;t surprising that these things exist, someone created a difficult to follow process, so trust the gadget geeks to quickly try to &#8216;automate&#8217; it ðŸ™‚

        Just saw this, a whole list of MiniMac sized PCs&#8230;. maybe Mac folks would say it isn&#8217;t about the size, it is about the experience&#8230; but I&#8217;m sure the size matters to some degree.

        Google and various blog software vendors recently announced a method to deter comment spam by reducing its benefit to the spammer&#8230; it sounds like a pretty good idea, so I updated my installation of .Text to use this new attribute in the comment section by adding just a single line within comments.cs: namelink.Attributes[&#8220;rel&#8221;] = &#8220;nofollow&#8221;; &#8230; now, let&#8217;s just hope it works ðŸ˜‰
I think I might enhance this a bit later, adding the idea of approved comments that don&#8217;t get this attribute for their links, since I see no reason why a non-spammer&#8217;s comment shouldn&#8217;t give them google-juice.

        When I first came down to the US, I had to pick a doctor and go in for a physical, and when the doctor was done with all the various procedures he needed to perform, he asked me if I had any particular health concerns. I really only had one, but I didn&#8217;t see the point in mentioning it, I didn&#8217;t really think there was anything he would be able to do for me anyway.

        I few people emailed me to ask if the various free (referral based) offers out there are working for me&#8230; well, yes and no. I have 4 out of the 8 referrals required for a free flat screen, 1 out of 11 for the free mini mac and none for the free Personal Video Player&#8230; which makes sense actually, I blogged about the first, I&#8217;ve never really talked about the mini mac one, but there is a little button link on this page so it gets a little bit of traffic, and I have never before mentioned the video player one&#8230; so it isn&#8217;t getting any traffic at all.
