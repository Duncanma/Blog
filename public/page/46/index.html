        Ok, so here&#8217;s the scoop&#8230; Robert Green, the Visual Basic PM focused on Community, is going to be in charge of the /community portion of the VB developer center on MSDN from now on&#8230; updating it, designing it, blogging about it, etc&#8230;.
What does this mean?
Well, for one thing it means a big change in content today, but it also means much more frequent updates and a ton of VB community information available from one place.

        Ok, so any action you take against your database is your own responsibility&#8230; so this is my fault, but I&#8217;m still miffed.
I installed the new drop of the Forums code from Rob Howard and co&#8230; and one of the various bits of information I picked up from the support forum and the docs was that I could happily install this onto an existing database because (quoting from the readme here)&#8230; &#8220;All the objects in the Forums product use the forums_ prefix so there shouldn&#8217;t be any problem&#8221; .

        I need authentication and role based security for another project that is coming soon, so I&#8217;ve put forums up at http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/forums/ &#8230; nothing there at the moment, but feel free to visit the &#8216;discussion&#8217; forum and contribute your ideas&#8230;
 What forums should I add? I was thinking one per article I write (for ongoing discussion) but what else? There are lots of forums in the world, is there something missing that could exist&#8230;

        In a previous post, I mentioned that a flaw in the installation routines for telligent&#8217;s forum system resulted in the deletion of a fairly important set of data&#8230; well, after posting that, a few things happened that impressed me&#8230;
 My web host, easerve, contacted me and let me know they had daily backups of my data available&#8230; and once I told them the date/time at which I blew away my data, they&#8217;d provide the appropriate backup file&#8230; (which they did, and I&#8217;m rocking along now with my old data back&#8230;) &#8230; yet another great bit of customer service from easerve&#8230;  Rob Howard and Jason Alexander, both from telligent responded with both &#8216;sorry&#8217; and &#8216;we&#8217;ll fix our scripts&#8217;&#8230; a very quick response considering I didn&#8217;t even email them about it&#8230;   Overall, my annoying little incident resulted in a great response from two different groups&#8230; very nice.

        I created a Pocket PC remote for Windows Media Player, but I only had speakers right next to the music system&#8230; so the remote wasn&#8217;t all that useful&#8230; but I just picked up this wireless speaker;
 
 and suddenly it is time to install that software again &#8230; my wife now puts the speaker wherever she is during the day, but having to go into my office and login to change the music is a small annoyance, so I hope the visual remote helps make it easier.

        Olav Gausaker, a programmer who reads my Coding 4 Fun columns just emailed me with something cool&#8230; he wrote (before reading my column on the topic) a web based version of my &#8220;Halo2 Countdown&#8221; application from July&#8230; very nice&#8230; in fact, with the large images (refresh to see a variety of different pictures), I kinda like his better&#8230; except for being in Spanish, and on the web&#8230; 🙂
