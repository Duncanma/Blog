        A while ago I moved out of the Content Strategist role and over onto the development team at MSDN, but until this week my position had remained empty! Well, the wait is over, Brad McCabe has joined the illustrious content strategist team at MSDN. No &#8216;official&#8217; link to point you to yet, but I&#8217;m sure a blog will follow soon!
Of course, a google MSN search turns up a variety of articles and speaking appearances&#8230; even a bio!

        or am I being scribbled?
I just noticed that the staged version of the VB developer center (our pre-production version where we publish the site prior to pushing it live) has Brad&#8217;s picture and blog on the home page&#8230; making this my last post that will show up on that page üôÇ
Of course, my blog isn&#8217;t going away, but you get to look at someone else&#8217;s face and commentary on MSDN instead of me!

        If you sign up for one of the sites created by Gratis (free flat screens, free ipods, free handbags, etc&#8230;) then one of the available offers is Zooba.com, and I have to say it is one of the best offers I&#8217;ve tried. Basically, if you are someone who likes to read then you probably won&#8217;t mind the &#8216;requirement&#8217; to complete this offer. You sign up for a membership with Zooba, which costs around $10 a month and for that fee you get one hardcover book each month with no shipping costs.

        Richard Grimes posted some fairly negative thoughts around .NET and VB.NET specifically, comments that Scott decided to reply to with his own post.
I have to say that Richard&#8217;s comments about C# vs. VB.NET are something that I hear all the time, that it is easy for a VB6 developer to pick up C#, and (just like Scott says) that just isn&#8217;t true at all. To pick just one example, case-sensitivity is a language &#8216;feature&#8217; that leads to confusion and errors, and trying to work in that environment after growing up inside Visual Basic is a lot harder than people make it seem.

        Currently I&#8217;m running .Text .94 + a bunch of private modifications and some version of CS:Forums + a bunch of private modifications&#8230; so now that CS 1.0&#8217;s source is out, I want to incorporate my mods into the combined package and then migrate my data and get my site up and running on the new stuff. As cool as that is, and while I&#8217;m sure it has excellent tools/scripts for upgrading, I&#8217;m not looking forward to it.

        On the various programming forums I read, a common question is &#8220;how can I find out the IP address of my router&#8221;&#8230; for whatever reason (and there certainly are a few reasons that I can think of) people were really looking for their IP address on the Internet. In general, the solution was to hit one of a few publically available sites out there that display your IP when you view their web pages and then scrape the IP address back out of the HTML.

        I was searching the web for details on how best to take all the various body measurements that is a standard part of any personal training program, when my search brought me to this essay.
 Girls are indoctrinated at a very young age that Barbie is how a woman is supposed to look (i.e. no fat anywhere on your body, but huge breasts). NOTE: If Barbie were life-size, she would stand 5‚Äô9‚Äù and weigh 110 lb.

        No idea what we&#8217;ve caught, but everyone in my family is sick&#8230;. and it has lasted for three days so far. Fever, shivering, sniffling, coughing, ugh&#8230; This was the first year that we all got flu shots and I&#8217;ll tell you, we have never been sick so often üôÇ
Of course, it is also Connor&#8217;s first year in pre-school, so that could be a more likely cause&#8230; all those germ-buckets playing together can really spread a cold around.

        Sign-ups seem to have plateaued, I posted that I had 2 left for the free flat screen site on February 16th, and I&#8217;m still at the same point. What I do have though, is about 15 &#8220;yellows&#8221; which means a person signed up but never completed an offer&#8230; everyone starts out yellow before going to &#8220;green&#8221; and becoming a valid referral counting towards the number you need, so all those yellows can lead to a false sense of accomplishment :).

        A friend of mine at work just asked me this VB question, and it is an interesting one to me because it isn&#8217;t as simple as it seems&#8230;
 How do I cast from Integer to IntPtr?
 In the end, I never really found an answer to that question, but I found out how to create a new IntPtr from an existing Integer and that seems close enough. You see, CType doesn&#8217;t work because there isn&#8217;t a defined conversion between the two types, and DirectCast only works with object references not value types like IntPtr.
