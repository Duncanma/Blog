        I put Chris Sells{.broken_link}&#8216;s most recent article onto the C# home page today, which meant we needed a &#8216;feature&#8217; graphic&#8230; luckily we have another Chris on staff who handles our graphic needs (Chris Mowrer) and he whipped something up.

        I have been drooling over this for that last few weeks&#8230;
 _inner monologue: it doesn&#8217;t do anything that I really need, and if I ever get around to hooking my current music system{.brokenlink} up with something better than S-Video, I could probably replicate its functionality in a pretty short period of time&#8230;.
 but, it sure looks cool, and that has added it to an overly long list of &#8216;things I would buy if I had the $$ to order them and the time to use them&#8217;.

        I&#8217;ve been working on the business and data layers for a web system and, as you might expect, I&#8217;ve been making quite a bit of use of ASP.NET&#8217;s caching system. Now, to test the business layer, I had gone ahead and set up a non-ASP.NET caching system as well using my standard method for caching in Windows applications, a static hashtable with strongly typed string keys (works well, fairly compatible with the ASP.

        I see by Kent&#8217;s latest post that we&#8217;ve gone public with our new aliases.. in the great tradition of Early and Adopter, we have decided we should be known as &#8216;adhoc and random&#8217;. Details won&#8217;t be coming, but let&#8217;s just say that we have a reputation at our workplace as being a bit too quick to write and ship code when we want something done&#8230;
We are working on that problem though&#8230; I think we are scheduled to attend a support group next week, and we aren&#8217;t allowed to code during the meeting&#8230;.

        It has been one of those days&#8230; so much content being worked on, almost none of it visible on MSDN yet&#8230; but it is coming!
If you were watching closely (and I didn&#8217;t expect you to be), you&#8217;ll have noticed some subtle changes on the Dev Centers&#8230; my pic went up onto http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic, I created a new books page at http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/using/books and there are quite a few changes coming for the C# Developer Center as well&#8230;

        Kent used a phrase a few days ago &#8220;loaded for bear&#8221;, and while I can&#8217;t even really explain what it meant (though Google certainly can), it makes me laugh every time I think of it&#8230;
Anyway, I recently bought a home machine (from Dell, because I realized that if I built it myself I would probably spend weeks doing it for 20-30 minutes a night), and I&#8217;ve finally loaded it up with VS.

        Now, it is helping me to find things! The blog page on my personal site{.broken_link} has become stuck in DVI/HDTV/Component Video land after one of my posts, all of the ads are about HDTV related stuff&#8230; but, this{.broken_link} just appeared and it looks pretty cool. Not the most visually appealing device, but I&#8217;m thinking that it could be hidden away and just controlled by a IR emitter&#8230;

        I have to learn the keyboard/mouse commands, and quickly. My boss just sent out an invitation to a Halo PC LAN fest&#8230; so, while I managed to resist tempation for two days&#8230; now I just have no choice.

        The VS team has produced a &#8216;preview&#8217; version of a new plug-in&#8230;
 Setup projects in Visual Studio .NET 2003 can be used to install the .NET Framework with your application, but only if you have installed the optional Visual Studio .NET Framework Bootstrapper Plug-in on your development computer. The Visual Studio .NET Framework Bootstrapper Plug-in modifies the behavior of the Setup project&#8217;s Bootstrapper property to include the .NET Framework bootstrapper as well as the Windows Installer bootstrapper.

        Ok, maybe a night of Halo with my coworkers has skewed my perspective on this topic, but come on&#8230; wouldn&#8217;t that just be the coolest&#8230; maybe the little alien guys, the chief, Cortona (not sure on the spelling for that one)&#8230;
