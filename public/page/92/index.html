        My twitter app uses a web service hosted on my site to get all the necessary Xbox Live info&#8230;. way more than the twitter app actually uses. This is a SOAP API, located here:
http://duncanmackenzie.net/services/XboxInfo.asmx{.broken_link}
&nbsp;
I know that some people prefer a more RESTful API though, so I also have another &#8216;page&#8217; that you can call with a straight GET request and just pass the gamertag in as a query string parameter:

        Ok, ok&#8230;. so I should have built-in an auto-update, ClickOnce would have been easy enough&#8230;. but anyway&#8230;. I&#8217;ve added many features to the Xbox to Twitter application, including support for only updating when the title being played changes, not showing popups and even a preview of what your twitter updates will look like once they are combined with your template.
To update, uninstall the client using your Control Panel then click on the install link{.

        A few people have emailed me or posted comments wondering how I grab the Xbox Info for the Twitter app and for my services.
It is not from scraping and it is not from any publicly available source. I joined the Xbox Community Developer Program (XCDP), which is an official program designed to support folks who are building community sites (forums, reviews, blogs, etc&#8230;) around Xbox related topics.
Many folks who want Xbox info, are not working on a large site like the people in the XCDP, which is exactly why I created my service.

        Family Gaming with the K-6 Crowd
 With Father&#8217;s Day coming up, I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about my own Dad and how I got into videogames as a kid. My parents, perhaps swayed by George Plimpton&#8217;s television commercials, went out and bought an Intellivision for the family. It was to be a Christmas gift for all of us, not just for me and my brother. It was hooked up to the only TV in the house, right in the living room where we spent our evenings.

        I haven&#8217;t had to write a parser since university, but if I had to write one now I&#8217;d definitely be checking out Tommy Carlier&#8217;s 10 part series showing how to write a parser for a demo programming language of his own creation.

        It has been &#8216;marketized&#8217; a bit from how I originally wrote it (with the addition of a product name right into the title for one), but a &#8216;father&#8217;s day&#8217; article from me is up on Xbox.com
 Keep in Touch with Xbox LIVE Vision

It&#8217;s an interesting time of year for Dads. High school graduation is just around the corner and college graduation has probably already happened.

        We (the dev team behind Channel 9, Channel 10, Mix Online, and others&#8230;)been doing scrum-ish development for a few sprints now, but we recently switched to using eScrum. This is a set of templates and tools for use with Team Foundation Server and it really rocks. There are few less-than-polished elements about the install and the web interface, but I&#8217;m glad they shipped it out for general use.
You can read a good summary of eScrum on the blog &#8216;A Developer&#8217;s Life&#8217;, which is also a good resource for lots of other Visual Studio related news.

        My latest kid-focused game article, which happens to be yet another movie tie-in, is about the upcoming Pixar film Ratatouille. Cool game, very nice looking&#8230; and it has entire missions around making recipes by spilling ingredients&#8230; just like how I cook at home!
