        I&#8217;ve been using the Application Updater Block, as you may have gathered from some of my previous posts, and I like it a lot&#8230; but I&#8217;ve been wanting to add a few features to it. Well, I have it all planned out in my head, but I haven&#8217;t gotten around to it, so I thought I would at least throw out my feature ideas and see what people say about them&#8230;

If you diff this article with the pieces from my blog&#8230; you will see the work of Henry Borys{.broken_link}, the excellent editor of these columns (and a ton of other MSDN material)&#8230; the changes are generally small, but critical.
One example&#8230;. he didn&#8217;t like my name (Keeping Work Fun) so we now have Developing Priorities: Fun First{.broken_link}

        Back in June I published a column{.broken_link} showing you how to make a simple Pocket PC remote for Windows Media player. I didn&#8217;t know it at the time, but some of my readers have sent in links to a professional version of the same idea. Built using the .NET Framework 1.1 and C#, Zerama looks amazing&#8230; everything I wanted in mine, but built and supported by someone else (I love to code, but I&#8217;m happy to have someone else do it for me too!

        Kent has been posting pics and my glasses made it into the shot{.broken_link}! Wow, this is pretty exciting, I think I&#8217;ll go lie down.
Here&#8217;s another pic from that day&#8230; just to keep up with the trend;
note the lack of glasses&#8230; generally a sign of a bad day,
it means I was busy holding my head in my hands or rubbing my eyes ðŸ™‚

        I took the test Chris has been talking about{.broken_link}, ended up as an ENTJ as well&#8230; I didn&#8217;t read the descriptions before or after&#8230; but I think I get the general idea.
As Chris was saying, I bet we could come up with quite a few similar traits amongst people at Microsoft&#8230; even my son has noticed. Whenever he sees another Microsoft developer (t-shirt, glasses, maybe a little below the peak of physical fitness.

        You probably already subscribe to the MSDN RSS feeds, so this might be a duplication but here goes;
Drag and Drop in VB.NET finally gets covered&#8230; an important topic that needed some more attention gets its own article from Steve Hoag of the VB team.
There is a new &#8220;Ask Dr. GUI&#8221; up&#8230; and although these Q&amp;A columns are a collaborative effort the main writer is someone{.broken_link} new

        I have a bunch of writing to do, but what I really want to do is code!
It turns out I have a bunch of coding to do as well&#8230; but the writing is more overdue than the coding (at the moment)!
Of course, I could just say to hell with them both and go play some SW:KOTOR, but I finished it a couple of nights ago and I&#8217;m not quite ready to start again&#8230; although the dark path should provide some interesting replay value.

        Well, I haven&#8217;t produced anything of staggering brillance tonight, but I&#8217;m a little less behind on some of my writing obligations (now those SAMS editors will stop posting my picture in the coffee room with nasty words beneath it)&#8230; still behind on 3 or 4 other projects, but progress is progress&#8230; I&#8217;m not going to complain!
Some very cool stuff coming soon on the Visual C# Developer Center, which I have recently taken over &#8216;stewardship&#8217; of, I&#8217;ll leave it to someone else to give away details if he wants and just say that if you care at all about the C# language itself, beyond the basics, then you are going to want to spend some time at the developer center in the next while!

        Like Card, I earn much of my living on intellectual property, and I don&#8217;t buy 90% of the arguments in favor of internet &#8220;music sharing&#8221;. In my view, it&#8217;s theft. If you want to do it anyway, at least be honest about it, rather than trying to tart it up as justice for the &#8220;rapacious&#8221; record companies.
