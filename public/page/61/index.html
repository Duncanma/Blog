        I used to get knee pain all the time, just walking down stairs would cause quite an ache, but after I dropped some weight that went away&#8230; now it seems that pounding my legs onto the pavement over and over again is firing it back up again, and it is getting bad enough that I&#8217;m feeling reluctant to run as often as I have been. Seeing me limp my way down the stairs into the changing room, someone that I was running with mentioned glucosamine, saying that it really helps repair the damaged &#8216;stuff&#8217; that is leading to the discomfort when I run down large hills.

        When my brother took me to buy running shoes a few years ago, he made a point of showing me a couple of ways to lace them up based on the fit I needed&#8230; but over time I forgot, and now I have new shoes&#8230; luckily for me, the web saves the day (like usual) and I found this on the new balance site: Lacing for Better Fit

        It was a very enjoyable summer weekend for our little family, including a trip today to pick raspberries (tons of fun, easy to pick&#8230;) and strawberries (very tasty&#8230; but much less enjoyable to be squatting down in the tiny little space between the rows trying to dig through the little bushes looking for ripe strawberries&#8230;) out at a local place called Remlinger Farms.
We only picked for around an hour, at that is moving at the speed of a 4 year old, and ended up with a nice pile of berries.

        As my lack of posts might suggest, I&#8217;m completely under water these days at work, but I did find time to take a week long vacation back to Winnipeg, Manitoba. While I was there I snapped this shot of a sign that I&#8217;ve been amused by for a few years now&#8230; (click the picture to see the full size version)
 I guess I would understand this text in a yellow-pages ad, if you know you have to find a place that offers this service you&#8217;d be looking in that section of the yellow-pages and this would be useful information, but on a street-side sign doesn&#8217;t make as much sense to me.

        A friend of mine, through my wife, has been a stay-at-home mom for the past few years and is trying to get back into the swing of computer programming. It doesn&#8217;t take long to get out of date in the computer industry, so I can understand her desire to flex her coding muscles a bit. Although she could just go back to what she knew before, she has decided to try learning something that is completely new, which I think is a great way to go.

        RAS in to work, fire up VS and get some bugs fixed&#8230;. or play Halo 2?

        I have no idea when this is coming out, but I have got to get one&#8230; I&#8217;ve tried various remote keyboards but this one seems much better designed for lap-based use, which is exactly what I&#8217;m aiming for&#8230;

        My latest little ‚Äúlife adventure‚Äù got started on Wednesday last week‚Ä¶ Brian and I had just grabbed coffees and I was back at my desk working through my list of bugs when I started to get a wicked ache in my gut. It was bad enough that I was having trouble concentrating so I headed home early and ended up there by four in the afternoon. Well, I felt pretty silly about it, having to come home early with a ‚Äútummy-ache‚Äù, but it just kept getting worse and I had to ask my family to make-do without me for a few hours while I tried to take it easy until this pain went away.

        This is an interesting idea &#8230; http://www.exceptioncollection.com/, something that I&#8217;ve pondered before...
I&#8217;d have to know more about it, in terms of the privacy and security of their data collection&#8230; before I could recommend it without any pause, but I would certainly take a look if you are building a widely distributed application (outside of a single company/enterprise), and I would probably try to integrate with the Exception handling/logging block from PAG.

        I&#8217;ve played around with coding against the Messenger APIs before, but it seems that MSN has really gone all out now and released a bunch of information for coding against their search, messenger, mapping services, and more&#8230; check it out on MSDN as of today!
