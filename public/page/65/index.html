        Brian and I have been spending a lot of our free time working on an upcoming Xbox 360 book (Xbox 360 for Dummies), which has resulted in me spending way too much time thinking about the day I will be able to pick up a box of my own to bring home. Looking forward to that day, and knowing that Brian and I have almost completely different tastes in games, I thought it would be interesting to list out the 5 games on the 360 I&#8217;m most looking forward to, and maybe Brian will do the same.

        Landed in Vegas for the conference, talk is on Thursday&#8230;. I&#8217;ll be talking about MSDN2.microsoft.com, but more specifically I&#8217;ll be covering the use of the Virtual Page Provider feature in ASP.NET 2.0, so if that type of thing appeals to you, come by and check it out!

        I focused mainly on the Virtual Path Provider in ASP.NET 2.0, and how we use that to construct our pages on the new MSDN platform (visible live at http://msdn2.microsoft.com). I thought I should put up some links to additional information, starting with a link to the reference material currently available on the Virtual Path Provider.

        This is the sort of thing that happens with large development teams, one team codes in &#8216;fixes&#8217; that break someone else&#8217;s work&#8230; I don&#8217;t normally do this all by myself! I updated the Flairmaker to support Atom 0.3, then I updated my feeds to Atom 1.0 &#8230; great.
See the error, laugh at the coder&#8230; or will it be fixed by the time you click this?{.broken_link}

        You may have already noticed this, but the current build of MSDN2 has a bug in the way it colors VB code snippets, as you can see here (scroll down, there are quite a few problems in the code snippet coloring, see how many you can spot!)&#8230; turns out the code wasn&#8217;t handling comments right, text in quotes, and it didn&#8217;t have a full list of the VB keywords (so MsgBox was not recognized, for example).

        Looking at this map, my first thought was &#8220;I wonder if this will lead to businesses cleaning their roof?&#8221;, but then capitalism took over and I thought &#8220;hey, people could put ads on big roofs like that&#8230; it would be cool!&#8221;

        Swung by Best Buy in Bellevue today, line stretched out from the store all the way around the parking lot and over to the near by Home Depot&#8230; tents, heating lamps, chairs&#8230; even hot food being brought in. The guy in the front of the line, who I believe will get his Xbox 360 from Bill Gates, had been waiting since Friday.
Stopped by Fred Meyer tonight to print out a digital photo, asked the guy if they were getting any 360 buzz&#8230; they have 12 premium systems to sell, opening at 7am, and already over a 100 calls asking when they opened and when the line was going to start&#8230; that is going to be a lot of disappointed folks&#8230;

        About a year or so back I added  elements to the MSDN RSS feeds, which seemed like an obvious addition, but it wasn&#8217;t until recently that I noticed that my own feeds (coming out of my .Text 0.95 based blogging engine) didn&#8217;t have categories specified in them at all. Not in the main feed or in the per-blog feeds&#8230;
This seemed really odd to me, since much of the UI of the .
