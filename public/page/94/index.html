        For the price of $280, you can now get a new edition of the Xbox 360 console. This one is similar to the original core system, but with HDMI output, a 256mb memory card (so you can play and save your games right out of the box), a wireless controller,&nbsp;and five full arcade games. Perfect if you are more of a casual gamer or if:
 you have an existing 360 with a hard drive and would like one with a HDMI output you need a DVD player&nbsp;and/or a&nbsp;Media Center Extender (play all your Zune and Windows Media Center or Windows Media Player content in the living room!

        In Halo 3 multi-player you can customize your SPARTAN or Elite&#8217;s armor, with different variations unlocked by various achievements/activities in game (including one that can only be unlocked by being a Bungie employee). You can find out more about the different variations here, but it turns out that your profile on Bungie.net knows what choices you&#8217;ve made and displays your current armor configuration on the web site.
If you go to the Halo 3 Model Generator though, created by a community member, you can find the picture of any particular gamer you&#8217;d like (including yourself, which is how I found my picture, below) or create a custom image to plan out your own armor customizations.

        For anyone who is interested in using the code behind this site for their own blog, or who just finds reading code to be a fun pastime, you can go to http://www.codeplex.com/oxite to check it out. Of course, there are other blog engines up there, including blog engine .NET (which appears to be very highly supported and recommended by many folks), if you are in the market for some free blogging code.

        If you or your kids are all excited about the upcoming Bee Movie with Jerry Seinfeld, then you should definitely check out my latest article on Xbox.com. Along with the movie, an Xbox 360 game is also on its way&#8230;. and a demo is already up on the Xbox Live Marketplace. Not the most representative demo (more on that in the article!), but still fun and the game promises even more.

        One of their users emailed us to comment on our video quality&#8230; essentially pointing out that it sucked when viewed through their TV using TV Tonic. Well I was puzzled because, while we don&#8217;t ship out DVD quality video, our high quality download is quite good for a podcast. Turns out though, after installing TV Tonic and picking on10.net out of their catalog, that the feed they have in their system is our 512kbps WMV feed&#8230; which is certainly not the best quality around, around 430kbps for video and 320&#215;240&#8230; fine for display on our site, but not the hottest around&#8230; instead they should be using our WMV (high quality) feed (2500 kbps, 640 x 480), but I have no idea how to tell them about it.

        Great UI, podcast support, music video downloads&#8230; and a firmware that works on my &#8216;original&#8217; Zune.

        I&#8217;ve obviously been busy, I never even posted a link to these articles here&#8230; I&#8217;ve written two new Xbox Dad article in the past few weeks, one all about Xbox Live (to coincide with the Xbox Live is Five event going on) and one that I wrote this week about Viva PiÃ±ata Party Animals.
Viva PiÃ±ata Party is a great game, the &#8216;party&#8217; nature of it means that it is quick to get started, even for non-gamers, and the quick little matches means that you can pick it up and play even if you only have a little bit of time available.

        and the Group Manager of Platform Evangelism at Adobe feels the need to comment about it.
Let me summarize. Ice Cube is involved in an Internet video project and has chosen to use Silverlight{.broken_link}, and you can watch an interview with him about it in Silverlight. (on a side note, I decided not to include the video into my post, even though the instructions to do so are right there in the original blog entry, because it is set to auto-start when someone visits the page and I think that is just downright rude ðŸ™‚ )
