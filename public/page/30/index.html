        I&#8217;ve been thinking a bit about Generics lately, with the growing conclusion that I will mostly use the ones that ship in the 2.0 version of the .NET Framework, but wrapping my head around a few situations where I could see myself defining Generic classes of my own. With all of these Generics thoughts in my head, I went back and re-read this blog entry from 2/10/2004 by Rick Spencer, and I really found it useful.

        Hey folks, I&#8217;ve been working with the C# Team and two great C# MVPs (Jon Skeet and Nicholas Paldino) to put together a &#8216;live&#8217; C# FAQ. This FAQ is being run as a blog, hosted at http://blogs.msdn.com/csharpfaq and is displayed on the C# Developer Center on MSDN (at http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/team/faq).
This list of questions and answers is continually being updated, so if you don&#8217;t see an answer to your question, and you think it is a common one&#8230; please submit it through the &#8220;Ask a FAQ Question&#8221; area of the blog.

        Eric Gunnerson has posted some information regarding upcoming C# language changes, definitely worth a read;
 Customer Focused Design
Since February 1st, I&#8217;ve been getting a ton of negative feedback about the C# language, and two weeks ago we were notified that the FCLC was shopping a proposed rule, so we&#8217;ve been talking about the issue in our design meetings. It&#8217;s been a very contentious discussion, but we have reached an agreement, and since this is going to show up in the next Whidbey partner drop, I&#8217;ve decided to talk about it here&#8230;.

        Very little to say&#8230; I had a great time (and maybe I&#8217;ll talk about that later, but it is pretty far off-topic from my normal &#8216;content&#8217;), but now I have hundreds of emails to dig through&#8230; most of them have resolved themselves (they emailed me&#8230; Exchange bounced an Out-Of-Office back to them&#8230; they dealt with it on their own) but sadly when the problem goes away the email doesn&#8217;t (wouldn&#8217;t it be cool if it did?

        I was browsing DevX&#8217;s Visual Basic Zone (http://www.devx.com/vb) and I found so much great stuff I just thought I&#8217;d better point out a couple of useful items;
 Printing Info for VB6 in two parts (part 1 and part 2) and I also found http://www.freevbcode.com/ which has a ton of VB6 code snippets (and is also part of DevX, despite the different URL)  Pretty cool stuff, worth checking out.

        I didn&#8217;t know this existed&#8230; so I&#8217;m going to assume that a few of you don&#8217;t know about it either&#8230; there is a Blog site for MVPs at http://www.msmvps.com/, with some blogs hosted on that site (using .Text) and links to MVP blogs on other sites.
