        I ran into a problem recently, where duplicate IDs were being generated by my offline ADO.NET code&#8230; and I had no real idea why this was happening. I had set up the primary key of my DataTable to have the following propery values:
 AutoIncrement = true AutoIncrementSeed = -1 AutoIncrementStep = -1  This is supposed to result in offline IDs being assigned as -1,-2,-3 and therefore having no possibility of conflict with any real IDs used in the database.

        Ok, this may seem really odd, but I swear it happened to me&#8230; ðŸ™‚
Yesterday I decided that I would hook up my headphones and listen to some music at work. I do this all the time at home, but not often in the office. I fired up media player on my laptop and started playing a variety of ripped WMA files. Then I opened up VS.NET 2003 and a fairly large project.

        I was mocking up a UI yesterday, and I wanted to produce an interface that looked like Front Page&#8217;s &#8220;New from Template&#8221; dialog&#8230;
But I couldn&#8217;t easily replicate those little dividers (for Options, Description, Preview), so I created a &#8220;DividerLabel&#8221; with about 10 minutes of VB.NET code (2003)&#8230;
And, if you are so inclined, you can set the text to nothing and you have a line!

        It seems a few people had questions about the control I posted previously, so here are answers to two of the questions that people might be running into:
 What about word wrapping? Good point, turns out I hadn&#8217;t quite finished my code before I got distracted by food or coffee&#8230; and then I ended up leaving out word wrapping! You just need to modify 1 line to make wrapping work, though:

        jf has been having issues with my control{.broken_link}, and I have no idea why&#8230; if it will help, him or anyone else, there is the original version of the code and a test form available for download here
Now, for jf specifically&#8230; feel free to email me your code and maybe I can see why it isn&#8217;t working for you, thanks!

        If you&#8217;ve been reading my blog for awhile, you probably know about my column &#8220;Coding4Fun&#8221;, well now there is an entire site on MSDN going by that name&#8230; to be clear, this is not a site all about my column ðŸ™‚ &#8230; it is a site dedicated to the same concept though, hobbyist coding.
Check it out at: http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun
Update: way more details on the site available at Dan&#8217;s blog&#8230;{.broken_link}

        Everytime Brian tells me something that involves his portable media center, I think about getting one. He has the Samsung model, which I really like the look/feel of and it seems to work well (although the length of transcoding is a reoccuring complaint), but my only real plan for getting one was to sign up with pvps4free.com (only 3 away from completion!), which has the Creative portable media center, but not the Samsung one.

        I started writing this entry about &#8220;Giving advice on technology to friends and family&#8230;&#8221;, but I realized after I had rambled on for a bit, that it was more about technology decisions&#8230; when companies force us to decide between MP3 and WMA or iTunes and WMP or even Super Audio CD and DVD-Audio or Blu-Ray DVD vs. HD-DVD&#8230; in every case, there will generally be a wrong decision that you can make.
