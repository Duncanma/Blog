        Mike Dimmick comments on SQL Server&#8217;s licensing policy and compares it to Oracle&#8230; which puzzled me. I&#8217;m no licensing expert, but from my days in MCS I used to read up on Oracle a bit and it seemed to me that they used a similar model to ours in determining per-user licensing costs. So I looked it up.
Oracle&#8217;s per-user pricing is defined as per &#8220;Named User Plus&#8221;&#8230; from their own licensing material ( http://www.

        As Chris{.broken_link} already noticed, Charlie Kindel{.broken_link} is discussing home data storage and home servers&#8230; both topics that interest me for about the same reasons as Chris. I&#8217;m a big fan of Windows Media Center, I have a ton of WMA files, digital photos, and I&#8217;m starting to have 3 seperate places where I store digital recordings of my TV shows&#8230;
 Storage at Home &#8211; How to store that precious data &#8211; Part 1  If you are into home networking, storage and servers&#8230; Charlie&#8217;s blog is worth reading.

        In an earlier post, I mentioned that I had written a new system for producing MSDN&#8217;s RSS feeds, and those feeds are now live at the same URLs as the previous versions. You might get some duplicates in your aggregators, (since these are new feeds but with some overlap of items from the old feeds) but that should be temporary. Anyway, check them out (here is the one for VB) and let me know what you think.

        This is not about .NET. I just found a site full of information about standard patterns that are being used in user interfaces in both desktop applications and web sites, that I thought you folks might like.
 _There&#8217;s nothing new here.
If you&#8217;ve done any Web or UI design, or even thought about it much, you should say, &#8220;Oh, right, I know what that is&#8221; to most of these patterns.

        (I&#8217;m kidding)
Wikis seem to be nothing but free space for spammers&#8230; yes, yes&#8230; I know.. they have good aspects, but it seems whenever I get a link to a wiki, the odds I&#8217;m going to see what I expected are very low (and the odds of seeing farm animals in disturbing poses is high).
Today I decided to click on a link to see screenshots of GTK#, the UI engine in Mono, and they decided to post these shots onto a Wiki.

        I&#8217;ve been playing through x-men legends for the XBox, which has been a lot of fun&#8230; kinda like Gauntlet but with the X-Men &#8230; it isn&#8217;t as much fun right now though, because I went and got stuck ðŸ™‚
We are trying to save Colussus from the Nuclear Facility, and we found out what we needed to do, and found the spots where we needed to weld some brackets back together (doesn&#8217;t it sound like a cool game?

Sure&#8230; I think the Whidbey Class Designer rocks. But you don&#8217;t have Whidbey today, so you might be interested in a class building utility like this one from Mod2Software.
Check it out here
 &#8220;This program allows you to build, maintain, and deploy Visual Basic .NET classes quickly and easily, with no fuss. Simply point and click to add class items, tweak their settings, and deploy your class to your project â€“ it&rsquo;s as simple as that!

        Justin worked (and still works?) on the Terrarium system and uses that experience as an example as he discusses various gaming topics in his blog&#8230; including yesterday&#8217;s post on creating random world content.
 Gaming: Generating random world content and some consistency algorithms&#8230; 
_Generating random world content is one of those tasks that gets written off as a trivial matter. It isn&#8217;t hard to throw some stuff around a virtual space and call it good.

        Recently I transitioned the C# Content Strategist role over to Frank Redmond, but that was only the first of several changes for me at MSDN. Today, my boss made the rest of the changes public, so now I can talk about it ðŸ™‚
I&#8217;m going to be leaving the Content Strategy team completely and joining the development group within MSDN, focusing on the tools and infrastructure that MSDN runs on, instead of the content that it publishes.
