        ReadMe Item of the Day (from The Coding Monkey)
 Was reading the Visual Studio 2005 SDK Readme and happened upon this rather humorous note:
 Setup fails if the installation path is customized to path with more than 128 characters excluding the drive letter and the slashes. (We realize it is ironic to put this information in a file that is installed by setup, but at least you know that we know about the problem you have already worked around).

        My book is about to come out (don&#8217;t worry, I had a 360 to use while writing the book&#8230; so my lack of one now does not reduce the accuracy of the book ðŸ™‚ ), and I work at a place with probably one of the world&#8217;s highest concentration of Xbox 360 fans &#8230;. and I don&#8217;t have one yet. I pre-ordered from EB Games, but I didn&#8217;t pre-order quite soon enough I guess (October), so they haven&#8217;t gotten down to me yet.

        I love this&#8230; and the funny thing was, I had just finished searching MSN for &#8220;Phil Ringnalda&#8221; (because I had forgotten his URL, well actually because I kept spelling his name wrong when I typed it as a URL) without much success.
 Phil Ringnalda: Searching Where I&#8217;m Not Hated &#8230; I don&rsquo;t have any way of knowing whether Google first decided I was garbage, and then decided that made me a duplicate of other people aggregating me, or decided I was garbage because I was a duplicate of people duplicating me, but I know it isn&rsquo;t helping: the only time you should let search engines index the output of an aggregator is when that&rsquo;s the only place the feeds appear as HTML.

        Not to cause any form of infinite loop here, but I liked this comment from Betsy in her post about my post&#8230;
 It&#8217;s a great fit &#8211; Duncan went from content strategy to development at MSDN most recently, and now he&#8217;s going to be on the dev team of one of the most evangelical of teams.
 Nice to know other folks think I made a good decision&#8230; not that I need reassuring of course ðŸ™‚

        I was playing around with Yahoo&#8217;s term extraction service, as a possible path to tagging (this is the same service used behind TagCloud.com{.broken_link}, for example), and I created this C# class libary with a sample app written in Windows Forms.
Code is available for download here: Term Extraction (ZIP){.broken_link}.

        More reason to feel bad about not having a Xbox 360 yet&#8230; my brother bought me DOA4 for Christmas, for the 360, and it just arrived yesterday. I haven&#8217;t opened it yet, but I put it up on top of the TV and pretended I was playing it, using the most powerful gaming console of them all&#8230; my imagination! ðŸ™‚

        A discussion at work today, along with my earlier post about Phil&#8217;s issues with Google and MSN, had me searching like crazy for this comment:
 &#8220;I think they&#8217;re also vulnerable to being locked out of sites because they&#8217;ve missed the implicit bargain for search engines that my site being crawled results in listing for me. Without any public facing services how do I find out what value I am getting from allowing WebFountain to crawl my site ?

        Earlier I annouced that I was leaving MSDN{.broken_link}, and my last day has arrived. I&#8217;m pretty excited about starting with the Channel 9 team next week though, my office here is empty and I&#8217;ll be returning my MSDN machines today. Luckily for me, for the purposes of copying my old files over, I already have my new machine from the Channel 9 team, a Tecra M4 tablet PC. This is my first time using a Tablet, so I need to track down all the utilities and apps that will make the most of this cool convertible machine.

        Found the Media Center Sandbox today, via Erik Porter, and it is nice to see them using the newly blessed icon. I&#8217;d suggest they use a smaller one though, and update the feed icon next to their blogroll to be consistent&#8230; but otherwise its great ðŸ™‚
