Subject: New MSDN TV: Validating Business Rules with XPath Assertions, Pt. 1
After a break, while we updated our media publishing system, MSDN TV is back!
This episode is Pt. 1 of Aaron Skonnard&#8217;s talk at the XML DevCon:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/episode.aspx?xml=episodes/en/20031007XMLAS/manifest.xml
Validating Business Rules with XPath Assertions, Pt. 1
Some XML applications don&#8217;t require validation to function properly but others absolutely require it in one form or another to avoid disasters.

        Darren Neimke, Mr. RegEx himself, has written a cool article that shows you how to create a fairly generic markup system to turn text into marked up HTML based on keyword information stored in XML&#8230; cool stuff;

Surf on over and let him know what you thought of it!

        Robert posted some good info about the new changes in GotDotNet Workspaces{.broken_link}, and it was compelling enough that I went out and added aliases for my various workspaces!
 Visual Studio .NET Bootstrapper Plug-In is now http://workspaces.gotdotnet.com/vsBoot{.broken_link} My Music System is now http://workspaces.gotdotnet.com/musicxp{.broken_link} The File System Objects workspace is http://workspaces.gotdotnet.com/fso{.broken_link} and my stagnant API Viewer workspace is http://workspaces.gotdotnet.com/apiview{.broken_link}

        I&#8217;m going to buy an album as download-only today, from www.buymusic.com, and I hope it all works out as good as it sounds (no pun intended!). My biggest worry when downloading music from the various sites is that I won&#8217;t be able to fit the DRM requirements into my digital music lifestyle. I listen to music on my laptop, my home computer, on my music system PC, on my Rio WMA player and sometimes on CDs in the car&#8230; but most of the music sites out there (that I&#8217;ve visited) didn&#8217;t seem to allow all of those uses&#8230; but buymusic.

        I had planned on missing this year&#8217;s PDC, because we had been planning on launching a new application during that same week (one of many!!)&#8230; but now that particular launch has been postponed a bit so I&#8217;m free to attend! That wouldn&#8217;t have made any difference though, since it is sold out (and yes, that applies to us staffers too!), but I&#8217;ve just taken over from another colleague who won&#8217;t be able to attend&#8230; so off I go to buy an overly expensive last minute ticket!

        I am getting really tired of seeing web services (or RSS feeds, or .NET methods, or anything else) with large blocks of complex, structured data that is exposed as &#8220;String&#8221;.
You call the web service, you get back this big string, which you then load into an XMLDocument and off you go (or XPath Navigator, etc&#8230;) &#8230; but if they had just defined the real structure in the first place, I wouldn&#8217;t have to do anything&#8230; I&#8217;d have a nice &#8220;weather&#8221; structure or &#8220;employee&#8221; object inside an &#8220;employees&#8221; collection&#8230; now, I can certainly massage/convert/deserialize their XML (well, I know it is XML, their wsdl says &#8220;String&#8221;) into a nice object collection, but why should I have to!

        On my way, and I&#8217;m realizing that I have a bit of preperation to do&#8230; this whole trip has been so last minute, and I&#8217;ve been focused on building the web site that will appear at http://msdn.microsoft.com/pdc tomorrow, that I haven&#8217;t even looked at the conference schedule. To be honest, I&#8217;m only barely aware of what hotel I&#8217;m even staying at&#8230; I guess tonight is the night to regroup and make some plans for the week.
