        Greg Robinson&#8217;s comments today
were quite timely, I had been thinking much the same thing myself&#8230; Often, and
I find it happens more and more these days, I will go to find something on the
Internet, or buy something at the grocery store, and I end up doing everything
but the task I intended to accomplish. This appears to be normal human
behaviour, but it can be quite disturbing if you are short on time and have a

        Whenever I have to
code a &#8220;real&#8221; project, I end up building a bunch of components to deal with anything that seems
likely to reoccur. Sometimes the class or Windows Forms control I&#8217;ve created
never gets used again, but often I end up using them in a whole bunch of
additional apps. Anyway, I think I&#8217;ll post some of these little bits of
development work to my blog when it seems useful enough, and perhaps other

        From time to time, when I&#8217;ve shown someone a
system I built, I&#8217;ve been asked &#8220;How many lines of code is that?&#8221;&#8230; and my
answer has always been the same&#8230; &#8220;I have no idea&#8221;.

I&#8217;ve never even tried to count the lines of code in a project, and I have no
idea why I would. Jason mentions in his post{.broken_link} that some
people have to account for their lines of code produced in a day and I think

want it to go away! Almost always, someone writes up and posts a C#

        I have a lot of
code hanging around, and the techniques in that code would likely
help&nbsp;people who are getting started with .NET, but I haven&#8217;t had to time to
&#8220;polish&#8221; it up for public release&#8230;
I&#8217;m starting to wonder, with the rapid
pace of technology, if I should just release things as they are and tweak later
if I have time&#8230; at least they will provide some benefit to some people.

        I have been, since I started using .NET, a big supporter of
the &#8216;Smart
Client&#8217; or &#8216;Rich Client&#8217; application. I&#8217;ve talked about it to people, I&#8217;ve
dug deep into the underlying technology, I&#8217;ve built samples&#8230; big fan
of the whole idea  . On a parallel track, I wrote&nbsp;several systems internal
to MSDN using VB.NET and Windows Forms, but I didn&#8217;t make any of them into
auto-deploying apps (aka no-touch apps, aka HREF EXEs, etc.
