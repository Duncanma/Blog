        This new feature, which isn&#8217;t limited to Windows Forms, allows a single class to extend across multiple files, isn&#8217;t limited to Windows Forms but the designer-generated code is just screaming out for a solution like this.
Jay writes:
 
Winforms designed code and C# partial classes 
 In Whidbey, the WinForms designer takes advantage of a new C# language feature called ‚Äú
partial classes

‚Äù.&nbsp; This allows them to pull out the designer generated code into a separate file.

        Very cool article from Code Project; this is something I have wanted for awhile&#8230;.. from the moment we started outputing RSS from MSDN, it seemed to me that you&#8217;d want to view them inside of VS&#8230; I&#8217;m downloading this right to try it out, but the article is well written and covers a lot of good topics (like Isolated Storage, async delegates and more), so I&#8217;m pretty confident the add-in will work well üôÇ

        This time, he wants to know what you think about C#&#8217;s community:
 C# Community Review

&#8230; If a friend came up to you and said, ‚ÄúI&#8217;m thinking of using C#, but I&#8217;m concerned that there isn&#8217;t a good community around it‚Äù, what would you say? What are the good things about the C# community? What are the bad things? If you wanted us to change one thing, what would it be?

        Joe Mayo posted a great &#8216;frequently asked question&#8217; along with a very clear answer, to the C# FAQ recently&#8230;.
 Why did I receive the error: &#8220;The type or namespace &#8216;&#8217; does not exist in the class or namespace &#8216;&#8217; (are you missing an assembly reference?)&#8221; 
 If you haven&#8217;t found the FAQ yet, check it out&#8230;. submit your questions (please try to stick to common C# issues, not general support questions, as we are trying to only answer questions that would make good additions to the FAQ list) and comment on existing ones!

        I heard this was coming in a few weeks, but it is here now{.broken_link}&#8230;.
This is a free download, but note that you have to have your original CD-Key for this to work&#8230;. and that the version that supports custom maps is multi-player only and doesn&#8217;t ship with any of the original maps&#8230; the dedicated server program is included though!!
&nbsp;
[Update: Note sure about that &#8216;doesn&#8217;t ship with maps&#8217; comment I made&#8230; I read that in an article on the web, but the maps appeared to be there when I played&#8230; perhaps the new maps added in Halo PC are missing&#8230; but I can&#8217;t be sure]

        I&#8217;ve often had email exchanges and thought about posting them as blog entries&#8230; and now I&#8217;ve seen someone do it&#8230; and I have to say that it is a little hard to read (for the email part, start at the bottom and read up&#8230; which is normal for email, but not intuitive in a blog posting)&#8230; That difficulty is worth going through though because if you read the entire post you&#8217;ll find out lots of useful info&#8230; üôÇ
