        This is so very cool&#8230; I wonder if they need any programmers? Of course, my wife wouldn&#8217;t like it if it meant lots of travel!
 When you think of natural disaster, software programs rarely come to mind. But Ted Okada and Robert Kirkpatrick of Microsoftâ€™s Humanitarian Systems know from experience that where thereâ€™s a crisis, software can be a life-saver. On the front lines of war, earthquakes and floods Ted and Robert develop software applications that aid rescue efforts, assist medical workers, expedites counting and locating displaced people and helps disperse badly needed resources.

        Yesterday, Laura and I headed over to the offices of Penny Arcade to interview them about&#8230; well, about a variety of things, it was a very interesting interview.

It may be hard to believe, but this was the best picture I could get. Someone&#8217;s face is covered up in each and every shot I took, for some reason everyone was feeling very &#8216;gesturey&#8217; that day. At least Jerry wasn&#8217;t covered up ðŸ™‚

        A bit of an odd video on 10, sorry&#8230; but I couldn&#8217;t help myself, I was (and continue to be) so excited about the arrival of the iCup ðŸ™‚&nbsp;

        But with a really cool name: http://shootingthekids.dpblogs.com
This site is definitely my latest happy discovery on the old series of pipes we call the Internet. As someone who takes lots of photos and almost every one of them ends up being one of my kids&#8230; this site is perfect.

        I was surprised early to hear that God of War II was a PS2 game&#8230; and now this? I think it just the price that is scaring developers&#8230; scary to develop for a console that seems out of the price range of your target audience. I say &#8220;seems&#8221; because despite my own (biased) negative thoughts about the PS3, I expect it to be a pretty impressive machine&#8230; one that quite a few people will pick up.

        Met with Dave Mitchell from the Xbox team today to talk about Microsoft Gamefest. If you are going, drop me a line&#8230; I&#8217;ll be there with a camera along with one or two other folks from on10.net.

        Last year I managed to go from 205-ish down to around 175 â€¦ just by following the South Beach Diet and working out more consistently (shooting for 5 days a week, generally hit 4 at least)â€¦ but then I switched jobs to work on a new project (http://on10.net{.broken_link}, a site that has featured Chris a few times) and totally fell off the wagon. Now Iâ€™m 187 (for months Iâ€™ve been putting 180 into the treadmill, but I actually weighed myself Monday night) and Iâ€™m really depressed about it.

        I love this;

Shots of dolls in full-on fashion photo shoots. This would be a great way to practice your photography skills. Who needs models?
Check out the rest of her photos under the fashiondoll tag, great stuff.

        Ok, so I am so going to do this for taking pictures of my kids&#8230; but wait&#8230; I could probably do this on top of the video camera for Channel 9 shoots too! Now if I can only get my son&#8217;s collection of Star Wars Pez Dispensers away from him and put them under the knife.
