        I took Scott Watermasysk&#8217;s &#8216;book control&#8217; and modified it recently to display more than one book (moving it to VB.NET along the way), and I reduced the file it pulls from down to just a list of ISBN #s&#8230;. but then I wasn&#8217;t able to display the title of the book as a tooltip (like the original does)&#8230; so I signed up for Amazon&#8217;s web services and added some code to pull the book&#8217;s info through the web services and cache it for use in the control.

        Everything comes down to that one of those two groups to my son, and he seems to really like that idea (wouldn&#8217;t we all like the world to be that clearly defined). Today he is a bit sick and my wife sent me this message;
 Connor&#8217;s feeling pretty sick today. He still has a fever. We&#8217;re definitely not going to preschool. I explained to him that the cold is a &#8220;bad guy&#8221;, and that he has good guys in his body that are fighting him.

        Lots of pretty pictures&#8230;. lots more info coming, but I thought I&#8217;d let you folks know that I have put some of it up onto the site&#8230; but nowhere near all&#8230; about half the &#8216;productivity&#8217; section is still pending and I still have the debugger and platform sections to build out&#8230;
Anyway, check it out if you wish by clicking here.

        Had an interesting coffee with Serge Baranovsky,founder of vbCity.com and owner of a cool license plate:
We discussed a variety of topics, including the idea of adding a &#8216;user submitted links&#8217; section to MSDN that functions somewhat like what http://www.asp.net has on the home page (a list of resources that have been submitted by anyone who cares to do so, and then approved by a small body of insiders). What do you think of this idea?

        I&#8217;ve put up a new poll on my site:
 What type of database do you use for the majority of your applications?
 If your answer is &#8220;something not on this list&#8221;, why don&#8217;t you post a comment on this blog entry to let me know what item was missing from my list?

        &#8230; and it is almost ready to ship&#8230;.
The new system will result in a few changes to the MSDN feeds, the most notable of which is that our feeds will no longer reflect a certain time span (they currently contain all of the appropiately attributed items from the past 30 days), but will instead contain a certain # of items. They also have a bit more data in them, including the author of the article (in the dc:creator element) and a collection of category elements containing all of the attribution that we have applied to that article in our back end system.

        I&#8217;m working on the bootstrapper chapter for my upcoming ClickOnce book and it occured to me that a lot of people probably haven&#8217;t heard about the bootstrapper for Visual Studio .NET 2003&#8230;
 Visual Studio .NET Framework Bootstrapper Plug-in
The Visual Studio .NET Framework Bootstrapper Plug-in modifies the behavior of the Setup project&#8217;s Bootstrapper property to include the .NET Framework bootstrapper as well as the Windows Installer bootstrapper.

        Yesterday I started up my first Fable game, 3 hours of my life lost already. Lots of fun though.
Tonight wasn&#8217;t as much fun; I tried 3 times to play and each time I was stopped with a dirty disc error&#8230; not sure why that is, but after 3 times I figured it was a divine hint to get back to work 🙂

        Robert Green and I are planning a series of articles focused around Visual Basic 2005 Express Edition&#8230; quick articles, not a lot of text, but with enough code to do something cool and useful&#8230; but we need ideas, and we are looking for submissions of content. If you have some ideas, comment away&#8230; and if you&#8217;d be interested in submitting something, just let me know!
Thanks!
