        Recently we launched a series of videos about VB.NET onto the Visual Basic Developer Center{.broken_link}, releasing them only a few at a time&#8230; but now we&#8217;ve finished that process and all 101 of the videos are available on the site.
 Just a little note: If you experience problems watching these videos, you may wish to try installing the WMP9 codecs (or WMP9 itself, although that is not a requirement) or following the steps in this KB article.

             In an earlier post, I mentioned I was going to TechEd&#8230; and I said I would post my schedule when I figured it out&#8230; well, I haven&#8217;t figured anything out yet, but I wanted to let folks know the most important thing: I will be bringing my Halo PC CD and a hub&#8230; so if anyone wants to play, bring your CD and we&#8217;ll try to figure out a mini-lan party in a hotel room or something similar ðŸ™‚

        Look for lots of posts from the upcoming TechEd conference as well as material around all things VB&#8230;
 

Welcome to the VB Team Blog! &#8230; We&#8217;ll talk about the overall product and about all parts of it, not just the parts that are covered by existing blogs. We&#8217;ll talk about things we do as a team, whether in the office or on the road. You&#8217;ll meet and hear from lots of team&nbsp;members you don&#8217;t yet know, as well as ones you do.

Headed over to registration today, very very busy&#8230; then to the Cabana with Erik Porter&#8230; very very empty&#8230;. Erik and I then decided to head off to catch a pre-conference session, but even those were backed up due to the long registration lines. Oh well, back to the Cabana to wait for some great VB questions ðŸ™‚

        I flew down to TechEd today, and I made it to the Marriott without any incidents&#8230; and I have my first &#8216;Cabana&#8217; session tomorrow at 8:30 am&#8230; This means I&#8217;ll be hanging out in the convention center, in the &#8216;Cabana&#8217; area, in case anyone wants to drop by and chat about VB&#8230; there will be someone there for all the major technology areas pretty much all the time throughout the week.

        I wouldn&#8217;t have known about this site, if the site&#8217;s owner wasn&#8217;t sitting behind me on the plane to TechEd, so I thought the rest of you might not know about it either ðŸ™‚
 TryIIS.com is a new site dedicated to resources for evaluating IIS, and contains over 100 whitepapers and other materials&#8230;
 Now, I have no idea why they had to create a special site for this, when they have an IIS section of microsoft.

        Paul Vick, language guy for Visual Basic and unofficial spokesman for Krispy Kreme (look at the picture to understand that comment), arrived yesterday at TechEd&#8230;. Look for him around the Developer Division Cabanas (5 and 6), the Visual Studio 2005 booth and at the &#8220;Meet the VB Team&#8221; session (Thursday 3:15-4:30).

        Swing by Cabana 5 today (May 26) at 2pm if you want to chat with Anders&#8230;. Erica Weichers is here and is going to try and record it, but if you are at TechEd you should come on by.

(Just in case you don&#8217;t know the name: Anders Hejlsberg is the designer of the C# language{.brokenlink}&#8230; so if you are into C#, you&#8217;d probably enjoy listening to his talk)_
