        I have no idea what this means. I get it all the time, whenever I hookup to an airport or conference hotspot. The connection always works, so the message doesn&#8217;t seem to matter, but I still wonder what it means ðŸ™‚

        Chris Pirillo is on 10 today, chatting about Gnomedex, his tendency to write things on his chest, and more. I don&#8217;t know Chris myself, but I joined his &#8220;FatBlasters&#8221; mailing list awhile ago as part of my ongoing quest to lose weight&#8230; and also as a way to get emails from Chris in my Inbox every few days ðŸ™‚
Oooh, just noticed he has a Torrent setup for Vista as well, cool stuff

        I&#8217;ve been thinking lately that blogging, podcasting and video blogging (vlogging?) show how individuals are able to create content so easily that the wave of independent content producers are sometimes more powerful than the large organizations they are competing with. This is not a new thought, but what I saw today certainly made me think it again.
Jyve is a Skype based app that lets individuals register themselves as experts in certain fields (French teacher, AJAX development, iPods, whatever) and then people can contact them (searching through Jyve&#8217;s directory of all the registered experts by topic) and start a Skype call (chat and email are also available) with them.

        We ran a father&#8217;s day themed bit on 10 on Friday, but if you are into gadgets you&#8217;ll probably like it regardless of the day. I like the Superman laptop from Alienware, the rather simplistic graphic appeals to me. For the desktops, I believe I liked the Star Wars ones better, but they no longer seem to be available. (actually, I couldn&#8217;t find any info about them on the site&#8230; but I tried out the old links and they seemed to still work&#8230;) Of course, the most appealing thing is probably the wi-fi finder&#8230; it is a bit more in my price range than the other gadgets&#8230; actually it isn&#8217;t, but the cheaper wi-fi spotters probably are.

        I&#8217;m certain I can&#8217;t enter, being a MSFT employee and all, but you can!
 
 While I was there, I noticed they are running another contest as well, for an Alienware PC, tied to the release of Jade Empire for the PC. And, while we are on the subject of BioWare, we might as well mention Mass Effect (Big BioWare RPG for the Xbox 360)!!

        I was down in Las Vegas a couple of weeks ago, and I had a chance to film a bunch of cool eBay based applications&#8230; videos should end up online soon. Some for Channel 9, some for 10 &#8230; it all depends on the topic.

This is a shot of me interviewing one of the guys behind mceAuction, Christoph Buenger (CEO of Scendix).

        Sometimes I don&#8217;t like being just the guy behind the scenes ðŸ™‚
It isn&#8217;t anyone&#8217;s fault, everyone on our team is aware of the work I do, but sometimes I wish it was more visible to the public. I guess it is because I&#8217;m used to writing articles, that have my name so prominently attached, or blog posts that are so clearly mine&#8230; but when I work on videos for 10, I can be the guy who set up the interview, contacted all the right folks to make it happen and even (in this case) went over and held the camera&#8230; but yet, my name doesn&#8217;t end up anywhere in the video or the post.

        I&#8217;m in Winnipeg for a couple of weeks, and while I&#8217;m there I thought I&#8217;d track down a few interesting folks to film for on10.net. First up on my list, Ed from www.geektragedy.com. I can&#8217;t figure out a way to permalink it, but if you can find the entry for June 28 (scroll down, or go to his archives if it has left the page) you&#8217;ll see his comments on my visit&#8230; I left thinking I should have asked him for a signed copy of a sketch or something like that and he makes it sound like I was doing him a favour by filming him&#8230; humble guy!
