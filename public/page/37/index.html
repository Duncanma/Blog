        Returning to the room tonight I was greeted by an amazing spread of technology across the bed in my hotel room. Early in the day I had returned to my room only to realize that my cell phone was not in my pocket as expected, so I had proceeded to pull everything out of my backpack, one item at a time, and place it on the bed. Turns out it wasn&#8217;t in there, it was back in the Cabana&#8230; but that isn&#8217;t really the point of this post.

        Cyrus, recent addition to the C# bloggers list and poster of many posts, has been blogging extensively from TechEd&#8230;
 OMGTHXURGR8!!!!
That&#8217;s basically the message we got today concerning the work we&#8217;re doing in the C# IDE for VS 2005. I ended up not being able to show people the new stuff on a person by person basis because we ended up getting too much of a backlog of people while that was happening.

        I get this question a lot, and I explain many of the same things that Paul goes through in this post, so I&#8217;d love it if more people would read this material:
The &#8220;native&#8221; .NET language? In the comments on my post on language choice, Patrick asked ‚Äúisn&#8217;t C# the language that&#8217;s most &#8216;native&#8217; to the .NET environment?‚Äù Christopher then follows up with&nbsp;a related question as to whether developers should use functions in the&nbsp;System namespace instead of ones in the Microsoft.

**
A while ago Eric asked ‚ÄúWho are the best C# bloggers external to MS?‚Äù which sparked a similar question in my own mind: Who are the best VB bloggers external to MS? I have my own opinions, but I&#8217;m interested to see who people find helpful and/or interesting. Just add your comments and I&#8217;ll post a list later this months&#8230;

        The 3 Leaf guys, (well probably just one of them&#8230; but who knows which one), talk about &#8220;Application Level Events&#8221; in Whidbey
Here&#8217;s a code snippet to illustrate what they are talking about&#8230; something that I like to think of as &#8220;Global.asa&#8221; (I haven&#8217;t done a lot of web work since ASP) for Windows applications&#8230;

        You may have been hearing a bit about nullable types in Whidbey (a feature in&nbsp;both VB and C#) but you should read this post by&nbsp;Paul to&nbsp;get an explanation of what they are, how they work and why they are useful&#8230; all from a VB point of view!
The Truth about Nullable Types and VB&#8230;

    There&#8217;s been a little confusion about how VB&#8217;s going to handle nullable types in VB 2005, so let me try and amplify a little bit on the

        For most folks working with ASP.NET, this should be taken as essential information&#8230; Don&#8217;t let the Whidbey reference in the first paragraph fool you, by the way, this post describes how to accomplish debugging as a non-admin in Visual Studio .NET 2003.  Debugging an ASP.NET application as a non-admin The debugger team has gotten many requests to debug ASP.NET applications as a non-admin. In Whidbey, the ASP.NET team did a good job solving this problem.

        Check out this link to go right to the VB section&#8230; lots of great info in there&#8230; or check out the C# section here.

Note that this is not a prototype of the next version of MSDN&#8230; it is intended to be consumed by the internal browser in Visual Studio&#8230; so the non-IE issues mentioned in the comments and the lack of index/search/etc&#8230; are really non-issues considering how this material is intended to be used.
