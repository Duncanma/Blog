        I don&#8217;t know about you, but I&#8217;m pretty impressed with the recent set of non-retro, original games for Xbox Live Arcade: Small Arms, RoboBlitz and now Assault Heroes

        If you are following Zune news, then I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve seen this &#8216;hack&#8217; to let you see your Zune as a read-only hard drive.
There are additional steps to make it so you can write to your Zune, but it seems so odd that you do it by starting a sync (a long sync I guess) that I haven&#8217;t tried it myself. I honestly haven&#8217;t thought of any reason I&#8217;d need to write to the device at this point either, but reading off of the Zune works fine and I&#8217;ve&nbsp;already&nbsp;found it useful to snag some converted videos files that I&#8217;d like to store on my PC instead of the originals.

        It&#8217;s been a few days since the big storm blew through, but I&#8217;m still without power (I&#8217;m at Microsoft now, so I can get connected and charge a few things)&#8230; which sucks when you have kids (and visitors, my in-laws arrived on the night of the storm). We aren&#8217;t too cold now, we&#8217;ve borrowed a propane heater from a friend and we have a gas stove to boil water on for coffee/tea (and to boil hotdogs with!

        I&#8217;m far from having used up all the gameplay in the initial release of Oblivion, and I haven&#8217;t even gotten into the expansions, and now they&#8217;ve annouced an additional expansion with a ton more gameplay that I can jump into on the 360&#8230; amazing.
 Even More Oblivion on the Shivering Isles{.broken_link}
Thursday, January 18 @ 11:10:00 PST&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Bethesda Softworks has announced The Elder Scrolls IV: Shivering Isles, an official Oblivion expansion for Windows and the Xbox 360.

        While working on a certificate issue for the &#8216;next&#8217; iteration of on10.net, I decided to code up a new feature that has been sitting on our feature list for quite some time. ASX files are very simple files that let you list out a series of media files and Windows Media Player will happily play them in sequence, so I wrote some code so that a URL like this:

        If you know me, or read my blog much, you&#8217;ll probably gather that I&#8217;ve fully bought into the WMA/WMV world. I&#8217;ve always been a bit annoyed at the iPod model of things as well&#8230; I mean, seriously, you can only use iTunes with iPods and iPods with iTunes&#8230; talk about crazy&#8230; people need choice, who wants to be locked into one music player or one music store?!?
Of course, I don&#8217;t get to rant about that anymore, now that we are doing the exact same thing with Zune&#8230; I don&#8217;t like it any better just because we are doing it, but I&#8217;ve decided that I must be in the minority and that most consumers must not really care about being locked into a single store/brand.

        My previous post&nbsp;about the Nike+ system left me searching for a similar solution for non-iPod users&#8230; without a lot of luck, but Mark let me know about http://www.sportsdo.net, which is very cool. This site/software uses any GPS enabled Windows Mobile device to produce some useful info about your activity (running, skiing, whatever). I&#8217;m interested and I&#8217;ll probably enjoy using it, but it isn&#8217;t really going to compete with the Nike+ system for two reasons:&nbsp;The first reason&nbsp;is that GPS isn&#8217;t a great solution for this type of use, especially for someone (me) who does at least half their runs on a treadmill&#8230; (hmm&#8230; the software seems to think I haven&#8217;t moved&#8230;), and secondly there is the question of the device.
