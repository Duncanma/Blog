        In a recent post to his blog, Paul Vick discusses the new IsNot Operator (and the history/rational behind the Is operator), which allows you to write;
 If myString IsNot Nothing Then  instead of
 If Not myString Is Nothing Then  and then, in another post, he covers the new TryCast operator (which is like C#&#8217;s &#8216;as&#8217; operator), which will allow you to save a bit of extra work (and produce a slight perf improvement in some situations) when checking to see if an object can be cast to a specific type &#8230;.

        Hey folks&#8230;. I&#8217;ve been thinking (dangerous, I know) and I&#8217;ve decided that you need to see more code. This might mean more code in this blog, more on the site, more pointed to that lives on other sites&#8230;. whatever, just more code in the end. I&#8217;m looking for topics though, what do you see as the most common topics that need code snippets? What comes up again and again when you are on the newsgroups and on the web forums out there?

        Someone recently asked me for our template, style guidelines and other details about writing for MSDN. I wanted to find the public page about this, so I dug around for what seemed like ages and couldn&#8217;t find anything even though I knew this was up on MSDN somewhere.
Eventually, I resorted to search and tracked it down at http://msdn.microsoft.com/aboutmsdn/submit.asp. Since it was so hard for me to find, I thought I should bubble it up to the front page of VB and C#, in case anyone else is looking for it ðŸ™‚

        Grant{.broken_link} starts on what appears to be a series of posts about a new C# language feature, with &#8220;Anonymous Methods, Part 1 of ?&#8221;{.broken_link}
 So what are anonymous methods? It is a way of writing an unnamed nested method that, just like most languages that have nested methods, allows access to all of the outer method&#8217;s locals and parameters, including the &#8216;this&#8217; parameter.

        Gregg{.broken_link} discusses &#8220;Why interop debugging is difficult{.broken_link}&#8220;&#8230;
 The Visual Studio debugger supports debugging both .NET code and native code at the same time. We call this &lsquo;interop&rsquo;. At first glance, this might not seem like much of an accomplishment. After all, we support debugging .NET code well enough, and we support debugging native code. What&rsquo;s so hard about doing both at the same time?

        Scott{.broken_link} goes into detail on the cool &#8220;Visualizers&#8221; feature of the Whidbey debugger in his post &#8220;visualizers for PDC Whidbey{.broken_link}&#8220;;
 Visualizers are custom viewers meant to be used at debug-time. They are entirely managed, and associated with particular types. Where before DataSet was a horrible mess in the watch window, now the standard DataGrid can be used to view the previously inaccessible data contained therein.

        Gus Perez has been maintaining an up-to-date list of C# team blogs, but after carefully duplicating his categorization in SharpReader, I thought I would try putting it up as an OPML file&#8230;
You can grab it from here, and import it into your RSS Aggregator of choice&#8230; enjoy
_(oh, and I ran into the oddest behaviour when posting this&#8230; putting the file up as .opml was causing IE to crash when I tried to view it, Front Page was refusing to edit it and I have no idea why.

        Matt provides us with some insights into the world of language design, a field that most of us have only dabbled in&nbsp;via a university course, with his discussion of keywords, operators and the problems with extending an existing programming language after its original release.
 It amazes me how difficult it is to design new features to a programming language. Once a language is baked in its original form itâ€™s almost impossible to add new semantics let alone syntax rules.

        Gus Perez{.broken_link} has posted the binary and source for a little utlity he has dubbed &#8220;ezClip&#8221;;
 Back in the 7.0 days I wrote a little tool called ezClip. It&#8217;s sole purpose was to allow me to copy/paste files from one command prompt window to another. Our test tree can get pretty deep directory-wise and having to provide full paths to &#8216;copy&#8217; was a pain and instead I often ended up starting up two explorers, one from each window, and then copying via the GUI.
