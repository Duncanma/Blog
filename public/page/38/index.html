        I&#8217;ve been using unpublished posts as a way to create planned blog posts for later&#8230; then, when I have a chance I go back and finish them up and mark them as &#8216;Published&#8217;&#8230; but I just noticed that when I do that, the published date is the date on which I originally created the unpublished post. I can certainly understand why that is, but I&#8217;m curious as what everyone else expects?

        I&#8217;ve added some functionality to my personal site because I now have SQL Server available on the back end&#8230; so, as a test, I&#8217;ve put a voting component onto the home page at http://www.duncanmackenzie.net &#8230; I plan to add some features to it (like &#8216;just show me the results, I don&#8217;t want to vote&#8217;), but for now feel free to check it out as it is.
Note that, at the moment, I am just using the component that is in use on www.

        It has been up for a few days now, but in case you haven&#8217;t found it yet&#8230; Andrew Troelsen has written a good article on programming Outlook with C#, covering using the object model and building Add-ins&#8230;

        As other people have probably mentioned here and there, there is a very nice&nbsp;health club&nbsp;near Microsoft and a membership to that club is one of the options in our benefits plan. Therefore, it isn&#8217;t all that surprising that most of the folks&nbsp;in the gym at any particular time are Microsoft employees. This can lead to an interesting occurance that has left me wondering (on more than one&nbsp;occasion), what is the &#8216;right&#8217; thing to do in this situation?

A conversion from integer to long form english&#8230; I could write that ðŸ˜‰ 
 
[Editorial note: A more complete sample is available through article: 
http://weblogs.asp.net/justin_rogers/articles/151757.aspx

  I find little conversion functions to be the most interesting type of programming you can spend your time on.&nbsp; You wind up exercising so many areas of programming expertise to make the algorithms short, complete, bug free, and as fast as possible&#8230;.

        In yet another great article from CodeProject, Julijan Sribar describes the details of drawing out a 3D Pie Chart{.broken_link}, and not only does it work, but his explanation is exteremely clear, detailed and includes lots of diagrams that really add to the explanation.

        Then, first let me say you have my pity, and then let me direct you to this nice piece by my old business partner (we started our first consulting business together out of our house)&#8230; &nbsp;
 
Responding to RFP&#8217;s

Many of you who are also consultants know that one of the realities of life is to write sales proposals.&nbsp; When working for large companies or governments you typically submit a proposal in response to a RFP â€“ a request for proposal.

        As with my earlier messing around with a poll, I took a concept from the www.asp.net site today and made my own &#8220;CheckDotNet.aspx&#8221; page. The one on www.asp.net only checks for the .NET Framework 1.0 or better, so I modified the logic to detect 1.1 and 1.0 as two distinct cases&#8230; recommending an upgrade for no framework or 1.0, and returning &#8220;Framework Found&#8221; if you have 1.1 already.
