        I&#8217;ve seen this around before, and this post was from June 2003, but it is worth mentioning again!
 .NET Html Agility Pack: How to use malformed HTML just like it was well-formed XML&#8230; 
Here is an agile HTML parser that builds a read/write DOM and supports plain XPATH or XSLT. It is an assembly that allows you to parse &#8220;out of the web&#8221; HTML files. The parser is very tolerant with &#8220;real world&#8221; malformed HTML.

        Part 3: Binary Trees and BSTs

This article, the third in a six-part series on data structures in the .NET Framework, looks at a common data structure that is not included in the .NET Framework Base Class Library: binary trees. Whereas arrays arrange data linearly, binary trees can be envisioned as storing data in two dimensions. A special kind of binary tree, called a binary search tree, or BST, allows for a much more optimized search time than with arrays.

        Actually, I&#8217;ve always wanted to mimic something simpler, just the error message and a more button to see the stack trace&#8230; but this component would be wonderful during a beta release, or as something that can be toggled on by the troubleshooting developer&#8230;
via Sijin Joseph
 Found some great components to integrate into my project.
 Error Dialog – I was always looking for a better way to show exceptions, one that could help the developer with debugging as well.

        Debugging Visual Basic .NET Applications{.broken_link} Join members of the Visual Basic .NET and Debugging teams to discuss debugging Visual Basic .NET applications with the Visual Studio .NET Debugger. Almost every program will need to be debugged sometime, so take this opportunity to learn more about debugging from the experts.

        A new sample{.broken_link} was posted recently by Joel Pobar{.broken_link} (a Program Manager in the CLR team)
 C# command line FTP server{.broken_link}
A lightweight implementation of the FTP RFC spec. Supports the following: Supports most of the common FTP commands that FTP clients like CuteFTP and LeechFTP support. Upload and download files Delete files Restrict a user to their home directory and further subdirectories. Late bind to a logging assembly (create your own logging infrastructure) It has not been tested from a security standpoint.

        Joel Semeniuk, (my former roommate, co-founder of my first software development company, and now a co-founder of Imaginets), is doing a security webcast for MSDN&#8230; something about &#8216;threat modeling&#8217; or &#8216;model threatening&#8217;, I&#8217;m really not sure which, but I&#8217;m sure it will be entertaining either way.

        While I did manage to find some really nice desktop backgrounds at http://www.ninjagaidengame.com/NinjaGaiden/images/wallpaper/wallpaper3_1280.html, I didn&#8217;t find a release date for the game I&#8217;ve been waiting for&#8230; Now, considering who I work for, I&#8217;m not one to talk trash about a company for slipping in their software release schedule, but I was a little surprised in each case (they&#8217;ve slipped more than once on Ninja Gaiden) that I only heard about the slip after the planned release date had passed.
