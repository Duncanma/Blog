        I just saw this in a recent MSDN flash and thought it was worth mentioning&#8230;

        I posted a walkthrough of using the Updater Application Block onto my blog back in the summer but Zac Hamilton has made some changes/improvements&#8230;.
 I took the Duncan Mackenzie Blog located at: http://weblogs.asp.net/duncanma/story/10221.aspx, reworked it and added some things I was having a problems with (some of which I was able to find through this message board.)

        Adam Nathan (author of this book) and the overall master of Interop between managed and unmanaged code, blogged last week about his CLR SPY tool. If you haven&#8217;t seen it, download it from GotDotNet and let him know what you think (through the comments on his blog entry).
 CLR SPY: Feature requests for the next version

Now that I&#8217;m set up at my new blogging home, I&#8217;d like to get some feedback from anyone who has used the CLR SPY{.

        I was just reading the latest dotnetwire newsletter and this article caught my eye.
 Synchronize Identity Values between Database and DataSet During Updates
After inserting the rows in the database your DataTable does not automatically reflect the identity values of as assigned by the database. The problem can be solved by the clever use of stored procedures and output parameters.
 It gives a very brief description of an important idea, how to return identity values from an insert without having to do another complete select query (even if you batch it together).

        Microsoft Research is a cool place&#8230; and if you had any doubt, you only need to look at some of their publicly exposed data, such as the NETSCAN system. I pulled a description of the system from their site&#8230;
 The Netscan System provides detailed reports on the activity of Usenet newsgroups, the authors who participate in them, and the conversation threads that emerge from their activity. Using the Netscan tool users can get reports about any newsgroup for any day, week, month, quarter, or year, since September 1999.

        I&#8217;m sure we all feel that the world needs another RSS Aggregator, and lucky for us&#8230; someone has written one 🙂
 Darshan Singh has created an excellent RSS aggregator using Windows Forms (and C#). RSSConnect supports skinning of the post viewing pane, searching and indexing of posts using the integrated database support as well as a number of other customization points.
Download RSSConnect from PerfectXML.com
 Seriously though, it looks like it has some interesting features around searching/indexing, so I&#8217;m sure it will add to that great pool of desirable aggregator features that all aggregator writers are helping to advance.
