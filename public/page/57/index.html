        I&#8217;ve recently unhooked my Tivo&#8230; I picked up a Media Center Extender (the HP one) and that was the final step to moving all of our television watching to MCE 2005. We love it and we record tons of shows. Extender works wonderfully, better than the XBox extender because there is no stupid DVD to put in to watch TV and it is a lot quieter.
Everything looks great, except for the occasional thing on some of the lower channels (5 and 6).

        I wrote a couple of articles on BITS in the past (creating a wrapper, then background copying, then digital grandma) but it was all about downloading files. Starting with BITS 1.5, you can also upload files&#8230; is that topic of interest to folks? Just FYI, you need web server support to make this work, as detailed here.

        I use the Exception Handling Block from PAG, so exceptions anywhere in my application generate a nice (full of data) XML file for me to use after the fact to track down the problem&#8230; but that file gets written to the user&#8217;s local machine&#8230; so I have to ask folks to send it to me via email. What I need to implement is some system to upload those reports to me either automatically or on-demand&#8230;.

        This topic has been in the &#8216;news&#8217; lately (well, at least in the blogs) and I&#8217;ve been considering replying&#8230;. but it turns out I don&#8217;t have to, because Dave Totzke has done it for me. I don&#8217;t really agree with his comment that we&#8217;ve kept C++ alive because Office is written in it&#8230; it is actually because the managed world doesn&#8217;t replace the need to write native code against the underlying hardware and OS.

        Check out my articles page, which is built from an RSS file by the way, and click on any of the &#8220;Coding 4 Fun&#8221; articles. You&#8217;ll end up still in my site, but viewing the full MSDN article. Mostly I&#8217;m just playing around, but it seemed &#8216;neat&#8217; enough to mention ðŸ™‚
By the way, the jury is still out on whether or not I&#8217;ve opened myself to various new security risks through this code, so if you want to try and hack my site using this new &#8220;pull&#8221; concept, go for it&#8230; I&#8217;d really appreciate it if you&#8217;d let me know if you find anything though, in the interest of science that is ðŸ™‚

        In my last post, I was talking about pulling my articles from MSDN into the chrome of my site. This type of system could be created using a frameset, but frames are evil, so that isn&#8217;t the approach I took. Instead, knowing a bit about the files on MSDN&#8217;s web servers, I took advantage of a special xml file that exists for most of our articles. This file is created as part of our publishing process and exists so that we can pull articles into the chrome of our developer centers (like this).

        (see this post{.broken_link} for an introduction to this topic&#8230;)
I&#8217;ve wrapped my code up into a user control that you place anywhere on your page&#8230; it handles the load of data and then you can access its properties to output the html headers and body of the pulled content. I&#8217;ve just been using Output Caching on the host page, but if you decided to cache the body/headers that would certainly work as well&#8230;

        The theme at my son&#8217;s preschool last week was Caterpillars, and it also happened to be his turn to bring the snack (the kids rotate through this task, bring snacks/juice for 16 people)&#8230; so my wife went all-out and baked these breadstick-larva creations&#8230;
&#8230; and these butterfly cookies. Recipe for the breadstick/caterpillars is here
Very yummy and supposedly quite well received by the kids&#8230;
