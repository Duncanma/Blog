        After going to the movie this morning (movies in the morning just aren&#8217;t natural, by the way) with Kent{.broken_link}, I was reading some reviews of Matrix 2 (follow the link at your own risk&#8230; they are full of spoilers&#8230;) and I came upon a wordthat had me visiting www.dictionary.com moments later.
I didn&#8217;t realize there were words for this type of thing&#8230; though more words along the same theme could make for interesting, if cryptic, conversations.

        My wife read my blog for the first time yesterday, and she has decided that she wants to try it for herself&#8230; but where to blog? dotnetweblogs is great, but this isn&#8217;t going to be a tech-focused blog (is there a mommyblogs.com?). I have my own site, it even runs ASP.NET but I doubt I can do much (if anything at all) with the server config as it is running on a shared server.

        Sean{.broken_link} mentions my last article, which was all about the new WMP 9 &#8220;blogging&#8221; plug-in.{.broken_link} To answer the question asked in his comments{.broken_link}, yes&#8230; grabbing the dll and regsvr32&#8217;ing it will allow it to work on Windows Server 2003&#8230; or even on Longhorn if you{.broken_link} are into that sort of thing&#8230;
Of course, I&#8217;d suggest that you don&#8217;t run WMP9, IE, or blogging client software on your Windows Server, but I don&#8217;t want to sound crazy

        That was what my 2-yr old son received last night&#8230; ouch. We were at a birthday party for a friend of ours and there were lots of kids running around&#8230; oops, Connor fell and slammed his forehead right into the corner of a wall. Cut right to the bone and bleeding like crazy. What a trooper though, he cried for a bit, mostly because of the look on all of the adult&#8217;s faces, but he had stopped before I could even get him to the truck for a drive to the hospital.

        and look at the stuff he produces{.broken_link}. Pretty cool, although I&#8217;m still planning to add the GUID and other attributes to the source doc&#8230; otherwise we will be creating new GUIDs on every trip (is that a big deal? it isn&#8217;t like we are going to run out of them soon, but I hate to be wasteful)&#8230; of course, you would all be even more impressed with the man if you had seen all the code and XML samples he sent via email at the same time.

        In an earlier post{.broken_link}, I mentioned wanting to create a blog for my wife&#8230; and based on a variety of great feedback through email and comments I decided to create an account on blogger.com, but I can&#8217;t get it to work! I&#8217;m not sure what I&#8217;m doing wrong, and they don&#8217;t provide anyway to contact them&#8230; but I keep getting an error that the username is taken and I&#8217;ve tried so many possiblities, including adding random numbers to the end of the name &#8230; I&#8217;ve stopped believing that the username really is taken and instead I think they are just having some other type of problem!

        DonXML was discussing the various prices he has seen on the web for MSDN subscriptions, and being from MSDN I was a little curious. I asked around, and it turns out we have a canned response to this question that you might find helpful (or not).
The sheer volume and ever changing number of offers, resellers, businesses, marketing programs and selling that takes place on the global commerce stage precludes Microsoft from being in a position to validate every MSDN subscription offer in the market.

        This might be common knowledge, but when Darren{.broken_link} was in town he mentioned that downloading our multi-media presentations like VBTV{.broken_link} and the .NET Show was too expensive from Australia due to the price of bandwidth&#8230; I had hoped to burn some to disc while he was here, but I forgot 🙁 Turns out they are on the DVD editions of the MSDN library subscription though;
For a brief summary of all seminars and presentations, with links to launch them, DVD subscribers should go to the \media\default.

        Yet another Developer Center has been launched, this one is all about Security and is being run by one of my colleagues; Brian Johnson&#8230; check it out at http://msdn.microsoft.com/security
Welcome to the Security Developer Center
As a leader in the software industry, Microsoft recognizes its responsibility to develop technology and programming interfaces that allow application developers to create secure applications. The MSDN Security Developer Center is a direct result of the focus that Microsoft has put on security and trustworthy computing.
