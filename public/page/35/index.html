        Back in highschool, I cut lawns for a lot of people&#8230;. so many that it was really a summer job and kept me quite busy, and then in University I took a job laying sod for a landscape company&#8230;. kinda went from the amateur level to the professional there. Both jobs were hot, dirty and left me ready for nothing but sleep at the end of a day&#8230; but I&#8217;ve often remarked to my wife that sometimes I long for that type of job.

        Paul Vick (Technical Lead on the VB team and author of this book) provides a list of key VB sessions scheduled for the upcoming TechEd conference&#8230; and his schedule for the week.
TechEd 2004 sessions (from Panopticon Central)   I&#8217;ll be there too&#8230; and I&#8217;ll post my schedule whenever I figure it out, but in general if you come by the VB Cabana (don&#8217;t ask me where that is, I&#8217;ll figure out on registration day) I&#8217;ll probably be hanging out.

        Giving us an early peek at his TechEd 2004 talk, Eric discusses how to handle enums in your code,&nbsp;since they are not constrained to the list of options you define in the enum and also because they can change in ways that could break your code in the future&#8230;
 
Enums and validation

&nbsp;&#8230; So, my first point is that enums are not sets &#8211; they can take on any value from the underlying type.

        Something must have changed, but I had no idea what it was&#8230; but suddenly, existing applications (the same version of which run fine on other machines) were crashing with IO errors, specifically &#8220;System.IO.IOException: The device is not ready.&#8221;.   &nbsp;   At the same time, I could no longer open VB projects in VS.NET, or create new VB or C# project (&#8220;path not found&#8221; for the C# projects, &#8220;Project &#8216;project name&#8217; could not be opened because the Microsoft Visual Basic .

        I answer quite a few questions on the forums on GotDotNet{.broken_link}, and sometimes those answers are interesting enough (in my opinion) to be exposed to a larger audience&#8230;. Coding this particular one{.broken_link} caused Brian Johnson{.broken_link} to say&#8230; &#8220;cool&#8221;, so it seems worth posting about here ðŸ™‚
The question was (paraphrased) &#8220;How do I stop AutoRun from happening while my app is running and the user puts in a CD?&#8221;, and the answer is that if your app is the active application, then you can listen for and respond to a certain Windows Message (QueryCancelAutoPlay) and choose to cancel the AutoRun/AutoPlay action for that particular moment (the next CD inserted will result in the message being sent again, and your code gets to choose once again whether or not to cancel the event).

Summary: This guide provides end-to-end guidance for managing performance and scalability throughout your application life cycle to reduce risk and lower total cost of ownership. It provides a framework that organizes performance into a handful of prioritized categories where your choices heavily impact performance and scalability success. The logical units of the framework help integrate performance throughout your application life cycle.

Unmanaged Debugging vs. Managed Debugging vs. Mixed Debugging.   All versions of VS support debugging both managed and unmanaged code. However there is a big difference between doing one or the other and doing both. GreggM has written about some of the

Here&#8217;s his first post:
 
First blog entry A couple of week ago I worked with Jay and Kevin on a little mental exercise. It was a lot of fun to do and you can read about it here: LazyLoader   After that I found myself responding to several posters about design decisions we made and the usefulness of the library we&#8217;d written.
