 Rapid Application Development with VB.NET 2.0 by Jesse Liberty &#8212; For a couple of years now, Jesse Liberty been touting the Microsoft endorsed-sentiment that it really doesn&#8217;t matter if you program in C# or in VB.NET, since both are just syntactic sugar layered on top of MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language, the true language of .NET). That appears to be changing a bit with Whidbey.

        A couple of weeks ago I posted my &#8220;Quick Poll&#8221; Coding 4 Fun column in its unedited form&#8230; was that useful?
If it was, I can continue to do that with my articles &#8230; basically posting my version of them up in advance onto www.duncanmackenzie.net and then redirecting that to the real article once it ends up on MSDN.

        I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be one of many commenting on this, but the recent updates to .Text on this site{.broken_link} are a wonderful improvement. For the past while I had been unable to really sift out the good comments from the bad, so real (non-spam) comments to the VB or C# FAQ sites, and to this blog&#8230; were all being drowned out by all of the spam. Keeping up with it (to delete the spam) was almost impossible and I gave up some time ago &#8230;

        Soma (whose name you may or may not recognize) is in a position to know a lot about the future of Visual Basic (in his own words, from his intro post&#8230; &#8220;My name is Somasegar and I run the Developer Division at Microsoft.&#8221;), so when he decides to post about it, it is probably worth a quick read&#8230;
 _&#8230;.A couple of the people in that session had some questions for me around our commitment to VB in the .

        One of the nice things about the Updater Application Block{.broken_link} is that it was written to be quite extensible&#8230; I saw a post today{.broken_link} where SamSantiago mentioned he had created a custom class{.broken_link} to delete all those old versions on your machine whenever you do an update&#8230;. very cool, I&#8217;ll be trying that out right away&#8230;
Personally, I&#8217;ve updated the updater in a few different ways{.broken_link}, but the most recent changes have been the most reusable, in my opinon;

        As I discussed in an earlier post, I wanted to know if people found preview articles useful&#8230; and at least a few people said they did, so here is another one&#8230;.

        And maybe the Forums code too&#8230; Nothing against www.asp.net, but I&#8217;m just thinking it might be interesting to host my own blog&#8230; moving seems disruptive though, leaving a large number of my posts here, new ones there&#8230;. what do you folks think?

        The age-old question of &#8216;how do I avoid putting funky Office HTML into my blog postings&#8217; came up on an internal email list today, and one of the answers was a pointer to http://stevemiller.net/PureText/, which I had never heard of&#8230; but it looks cool!
 &#8220;Have you ever copied some text from a web page, a word document, help, etc., and wanted to paste it as simple text into another application without getting all the formatting from the original source?

        Serge Baranovsky, the man behind vbCity, just mentioned to me that they have started hosting blogs&#8230; just their staff at the moment, but they have plans to grow&#8230; Since vbCity is already one of the best sites for VB developers, this is good news!
