        I don&#8217;t know if this is good or bad, but I thought it was neat that I could right-click the main project (excluding all our client script and HTML) that runs behind on10.net{.broken_link}, pick code metrics and see cool #s like &#8220;23,442 lines of code&#8221; ðŸ™‚
&nbsp;
Lately though, I&#8217;ve seen us reducing that number while adding features, so this might the highest result I&#8217;ll ever see for this project ðŸ™‚

        We recently updated a few of our web sites with code that would provide a &#8216;nicer&#8217; experience for browsers that were not compatible with the ASP.NET ATLAS (AJAX) scripts we were using. For some reason though, a few users who were running a fully compatible browser (Firefox 2.0.0.*), were seeing the no-script experience. We were puzzled, but one of the users figured out that their ImageShack toolbar might be causing the problem.

        We recently had Donovan West (LiveGadgets.net) build us a set of sidebar gadgets for Windows Vista. These gadgets use the RSS feeds from each site and let you see all of our new content as it gets posted, then (using Silverlight) you can even play our videos right there on your desktop.

&nbsp;
You can check out the gadgets (for Channel 9, Mix{.broken_link}, C8{.broken_link}, Edge{.broken_link}, and on10.net{.broken_link}) by clicking on the appropriate image below:

        If you&#8217;ve written an app, private or public, using my data feed of Xbox live info{.broken_link} I&#8217;d really appreciate it if you&#8217;d let me know. This isn&#8217;t a required &#8216;sign-up&#8217;, but I want to start to keep track so that I could possibly create a page listing all the sites using it, and it may also be useful to be able to contact folks if I need to make a change or take the service down for an hour or so.

        A new father-son activity for Connor and me has been to go to chess tournaments, spending a few Saturdays throughout the year in some school gym. Starting last year, we started to play chess at home and he enjoyed it so much that we decided to enter into the Shelton View Elementary school&#8217;s chess tournament in the Kindergarten category. He did well and had a lot of fun, so it has become the hobby of choice around our house.

        Well, this certainly isn&#8217;t something that happens all that often, but after spending all day at a chess tournament{.broken_link} (at Wellington Elementary in Woodinville) on Saturday, I ended up with a sunburn on my face and arms! It turned out to be a really nice day, which was good, since the waiting area for parents and kids (where the parents spend up about 6 to 7 hours, and the kids spend all the time between matches) was outside.

        It has been a crazy past few months for my health, or at least the appearance of my health.
For about 30-something years now, Iâ€™ve had problems with my tonsils. This has included one or more bouts per year of tonsillitis, quite a few cases of strep throat and a ton of colds that just seem to end up hitting me as sore throats and lasting way longer than it seems like they should.

        When I joined my current team, it was called the Channel 9 dev team, because Channel 9 was the big site that they had built and was the center of all of their efforts. You certainly wouldnâ€™t have known that from how we spent the last two years though ðŸ™‚
We built a whole new code base for a video blog site and launched a new site (Channel 10) on that code, bringing some of the video style of Channel 9 to a new audience.

        One positive side to being stuck at home for two weeks is that I was able to do a fair bit more reading. For the most part, I read magazines and watched movies, but my wife also brought me the book &ldquo;Three Cups of Tea&rdquo; about Greg Mortenson&rsquo;s work in Pakistan building schools for the children of poor rural areas. Mr. Mortenson, an avid mountain climber, ended up spending time in a small village near the base of K2 in Pakistan, barely making it down alive after a failed attempt to reach the summit.
