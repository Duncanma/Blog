        Ok, so the VB.NET 2003 version worked fine upgraded to 2005, with only one warning, but with the recent release of Beta 2, I thought I should jump on the bandwagon like everyone else ðŸ™‚

        No picture at the moment, I was just happy to get it hooked up quickly before my son came home&#8230; it seems I can never hook up electronics correctly when he is &#8216;helping&#8217; me ðŸ™‚
So, yep&#8230; one of those sites worked for me&#8230; it took a while, but my wife is very happy with the monitor. It is a 19&#8243; LCD from Sony (the SDM-S93 I believe) and it looks nice replacing her 15&#8243; CRT.

        If I ever get an Alienware machine, I suspect it would be their Media Center machine, but the preview images of these new Star Wars machines are quite tempting.
 &nbsp;&nbsp;
I wish they had a single PC though, not light/dark versions, I love the images they&#8217;ve used for both&#8230; it would be cool to have each &#8216;side&#8217; represented on the opposite sides of the PC. I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll never split the case out on its own, as the whole point of this PC is to get you to pick up their highest-end PC just because you can&#8217;t resist the themed version.

        This should only be an issue if you&#8217;ve written code that checks for version=6, instead of version =&gt;6, but that happens so you might want read the following blog entry about this new version.

        I&#8217;ve been messing around with using XSL to display RSS on MSDN, as a simpler alternative to a custom ASP.NET control, and while it works perfectly in the core case (display all the items in a feed in a format), there are two additional requirements that were very easy to handle in a .NET class, but trickier (for me) in XSL.
 Display the top n items  Out of the full list, display n randomly picked items   For the first, it was pretty easy&#8230; could be used to only output the top 5 items, for example&#8230; For the second though, I was stumped for a bit&#8230; then I came up with an idea.

        Back at the start of April, I signed up for a group fitness class at the pro club, the &#8220;Boot Camp&#8221; &#8230; a twice-weekly (for two months) running-focused outdoor workout that was supposedly modeled after real military training. Well, it wasn&#8217;t anything like what I remembered from going through basic training with the Canadian Military, but I don&#8217;t think anyone in the class would have actually wanted that. Paying to have people yell at you is something that only a small group of people enjoy.

        I&#8217;m not sure who invented this term, SAF, but it comes up often around folks who are into new technology for the home&#8230; &#8220;sure you might want to install a media center pc, but have you taken into account the spouse acceptance factor?&#8221; or the more common, &#8220;having to restart the cable modem sure reduces the SAF&#8221;. With everything new seems to come a few annoyances, so the question is whether or not the benefits outweigh the issues&#8230; and not in your opinion, but in the opinion of the rest of the people in your house.

        My wife commented tonight that my son (4) was going on at length about which planet was where in the solar system and how if you lived right next to the sun it would be too hot to live, etc&#8230; and suggested we get him some books on the planets from the library. This got me to thinking about a book that I used to spend hours and hours reading, I probably read it through cover-to-cover over a hundred times over the years&#8230; and a few searches later I found the title and author, Roy A.

        Man, I&#8217;m getting sick of people&#8217;s attempts to trick me&#8230; mostly because they are just pretty lame, and also because I feel sorry for the number of folks that are quite possibly being hit by these scams. One of the more recent tricks is sending me a notice about my &#8220;insert online service or bank here&#8221; account and providing me a link to go and enter my userid/password&#8230; and the link text is something like &#8220;https://www.
