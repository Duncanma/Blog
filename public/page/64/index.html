        For the last few weeks I&#8217;ve had a graphic and link to a &#8216;free Xbox 360&#8217; site up as a banner on my blog pages, and it has received a lot of clicks (and 12 or so sign-ups, although no one has completed an offer yet&#8230;). I&#8217;m guessing that with the difficulty of obtaining a pre-order at this close to the release, the idea of a free Xbox 360 is pretty appealing.

        I was considering adding one (or more) of the many aggregator-buttons (subscribe to this feed in newsgator, add this feed to your MSN start page, etc.) when I found this, one button that handles all of the most popular aggregators through a single link.

        I remembered that the 11th book in the Wheel of Time series, Knife of Dreams,&nbsp;was coming out sometime in October so I checked for it on Amazon today and it turns out it came out on the 19th. So (despite being fairly busy and having a real problem with reading non-stop through every single book I get the moment it shows up) I ordered it. Maybe I can get it in time for my trip down to DevConnections in Las Vegas in November, then I can read it on the plane and in the hotel, it would help keep me out of trouble.

        Xbox 360 for Dummies
By Sean Lennox
A new book entitiled &#8220;Xbox 360 for Dummies&#8221; might be exactly what some of us need
The new Xbox 360 will be released on November 22nd here in North America. To help you along the process of setting up and using your new fangled contraption, the creators of the best selling &#8220;For Dummies&#8217; series have written a book for the not so savvy Xbox users entitled &#8220;Xbox 360 For Dummies&#8221; The book is a basic how-to manual.

        I was reading the dotnetjunkies.com newsletter and I spotted these podcasts, a series of them that I have never noticed before, even though they definitely the kind of content I&#8217;d be interested in hearing.
 [
Moving to .NET from VB6 and C++](http://devnet.developerpipeline.com/documents/dev051026dnc/ &ldquo;http://devnet.developerpipeline.com/documents/dev051026dnc/&quot;)
Juval Lowy discusses the different perspectives that VB6 and C++ developers
bring to .NET including the challenges each group faces with the technology.

        I mentioned earlier how the Free Xbox 360 site was quite busy, and it is&#8230; tons of clicks, 12 sign-ups, and even one person has &#8216;gone green&#8217; which is to say they completed their offer. Once 8 people (who click through your referral link) have signed-up and completed an offer, then you are all done, but the sign-up to completion ratio is not great, probably 1 in every 5, so a lot of folks sign-up and then find that they either are not interested in the available offers or they don&#8217;t think it is likely that they&#8217;ll get an additional 8 people to sign-up through them.

        I only recently noticed that my blog software (.Text 0.95) had atom support built in, so I added a button to my main page, and then I noticed it was Atom 0.3. Since 0.3 was recently deprecated, I updated the Atom generating code to output 1.0 instead and voila;

Much thanks to rakaz&#8217;s great guide on moving from 0.3 to 1.0, which enabled me to update my code with almost no knowledge of Atom 0.

        Blogs and blogging software seem to be everywhere these days, and RSS has been a top buzzword for quite some time, everyone and their dog wants to take advantage of this new trend and technology. The problem is, it isn&#8217;t a simple process to create and maintain a valid RSS file. If you aren&#8217;t willing to run a complete blogging system or if you aren&#8217;t capable of hand-editing XML, then you don&#8217;t have a lot of options.
