        I&#8217;ve remarked to a few people that writing a more &#8216;consumer&#8217; focused book has been quite different from my usual area of writing (covering programming topics mostly), but this takes the cake.
Gadget Models, a site that seems to combine the two popular topics of models and technology, has run a feature that includes our book. Sadly, we weren&#8217;t at all involved. Note to anyone who is worried about the content of the site itself, I didn&#8217;t look through it all but it doesn&#8217;t seem to cross into nudity or anything like that&#8230;

        The source behind several of our questions for the recent Major Nelson bit on 10 is revealed, thanks Xbox Elle!
   A fun little game show, How well do you know your box(or is it Xbox? I can&#8217;t tell), was posted to on10.net on Friday. Laura and Tina try to stump Major Nelson with a bunch of trivia questions, and guess what, three of them were mine! Tee hee!

        I was browsing around on Randy&#8217;s web site after reading about an upcoming session of his at Makers Faire (hacking USB keyboards!!), and I found this: http://www.randywritesletters.com/005.html
All of the letters on that site (which has little or no navigation elements, so just edit the URL appropriately to go up to the front page) are hilarious, but for some reason I find this one to be the best&#8230; let me know if you disagree.

        I&#8217;ll be there tomorrow with Laura Foy (host) and Scott Finley (expert camera dude)&#8230;. and I&#8217;ll be doing&#8230; well, it is hard to describe what I&#8217;ll be doing, but hopefully most of it will be fun!
Check out the program at http://makezine.com/faire/ and let me know what you would want to go see&#8230;

        So I&#8217;m back from the San Francisco area, and I&#8217;m while I&#8217;m too tired to give you all the details right now, here&#8217;s a sneak peak of some of the things you&#8217;ll be seeing on 10 in the near future:


Update: the first Maker Faire video is up on 10 right now!{.broken_link}
Update 2: For some reason, this post is #1 on several search engines for the query &#8220;How hot is a flamethrower&#8221;&#8230; and I suspect that people who find this entry aren&#8217;t really getting that question answered ðŸ™‚ In the interest of helping those folks out, I&#8217;ve dug up a bit of an answer.

        Cool article on Code Project shows how you can have additional files in a .zip file that normal extraction programs like WinZip will not extract or list.

        This is from a great blog &#8220;SuburbanJoe&#8221; :
 &#8220;The fact that it is pronounced like &#8220;we&#8221; lets them say silly things like &#8220;Wii are going to change gaming&#8221; and the double lowercase &#8220;i&#8221; is supposed to be evocative of both the controller and the ability for people to play together as it looks like two people standing next to each other. Two limbless, hairless, featureless people who live next to a giant &#8220;W&#8221;.

        This group, http://www.bridgesweb.org, is an amazing example of what I think http://on10.net is all about. Phil Borges and the other folks involved with this non-profit devote an enormous amount of time to travelling the world and helping kids tell their stories using the new technologies available today. Here is a shot I took today of one of the workshop participants (Mel) helping one of the kids (Stefano?) take some great shots of a steam engine&#8230; and yes, I suck at remembering names!

        This is one of the cooler bits we&#8217;ve run on 10 so far;
 CalCars&#8230; Taking a Prius Hybrid to 100+ MPG!
&#8230;talks to the founder of CalCars and learns how they can convert a Toyota Prius so that it can be charged using your household electricity &#8230; power that is a whole lot cheaper than the gas a normal Prius uses to generate all of its electric power. Learn how they make this work, and how much easier it would be for Toyota to make their hybrids work this way in the first place&#8230;
