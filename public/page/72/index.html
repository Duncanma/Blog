        I picked up my copy of Elder Scrolls last night, turning down the massive &#8216;guide&#8217; (shouldn&#8217;t I be figuring out the quests by myself?), and after putting the kids to bed I fired it up. Hard to make those initial race/class decisions as always but I went with a Dark Elf Archer, under the sign of the Steed&#8230; planning to put a lot of time/points into Blade though, as I almost always do with my RPG characters (my AC character was named Kendo, so you can gather that the sword was a key component).

        So, another blog post in my series about how much I&#8217;m enjoying Oblivion&#8230; I really want to buy Blazing Angels, but it seems pointless to get it right now&#8230; I know I won&#8217;t play it. At this point, I probably haven&#8217;t play anywhere nearly as much as a more dedicated (some one with no children, and without a job that tends to lead to working in the evening?) gamer. But I&#8217;m still having a great time.

        Personally, I always hated it when people in various product groups at Microsoft would ask me to blog about a specific launch or event&#8230; because if I decided to do it, my blog post would go up into a sea of similar posts all appearing within a few hours of each other on blogs.msdn.com. How does that make you, the reader, feel? Like you are having information pushed at you through a channel that is normally about technical matters.

        That Elder Scrolls Oblivion guide book I mentioned in an early blog post today, I just saw that it was #20 on Amazon today. That&#8217;s just crazy!!

        I wrote my own for Trackbacks, which I used to incorporate trackbacks into http://on10.net, but Geoff provides one on his blog (that doesn&#8217;t appear to support comments, but does support trackbacks, so I thought I had better blog about it to thank him) that does both.
Silly me, I hadn&#8217;t built pingback support into on10.net, thinking that Trackbacks would handle most cases&#8230; but it turns out that many sites (including wordpress) only send pingbacks&#8230; oh well, at least it will be there after our next sprint.

        Yesterday my segment on Heart Rate Monitors went up onto on10.net, featuring a new monitor from Polar and the cool EnterTrainer product&#8230; check out the video{.broken_link} to learn more!
Oh, and unlike some of the comments suggested, lifting up my shirt on camera is embarassing&#8230; and yet, I did it twice on camera!!
