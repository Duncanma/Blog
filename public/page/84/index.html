        Video: Connor gets out of School
For those of you who aren&#8217;t in my family&#8230; no worries&#8230; I&#8217;ll stop with the videos now ðŸ™‚
This video seems a bit choppy to me&#8230; although the source material was just as good as the previous ones&#8230; hmm&#8230;

        Fairly mixed response over on MajorNelson.com to this game, mostly either people who love it or people who are wishing we&#8217;d stop with the &#8216;retro&#8217; games already&#8230; I&#8217;m a bit on the fence here myself, I like these games (Dig Dug, Time Pilot, Pac Man&#8230;) but I&#8217;m pretty disappointed that they&#8217;ve been left so &#8230; &#8216;pure&#8217; &#8230; I mean, I think it would be cool to have an &#8216;original&#8217; game mode that only uses a fraction of the pixels of my TV, but I would really like to see another mode (one that I think would be really popular) where the graphics really are on par with what we&#8217;d expect on a 360.

        As you may have noticed, I&#8217;ve been playing with Soapbox lately and it is rocking. Yep, there are other sites out there, but I&#8217;ve been finding the quality (it is all flash video folks, but there is still a range of quality) of the videos I&#8217;ve uploaded to Soapbox to be a few steps above the other sites (or is it just site now that Google bought YouTube?). Laura Foy from on 10 went and interviewed the Soapbox team and managed to get a special link so that on10.

        I&#8217;ve recently begun re-reading the Deverry novels; I just went through Daggerspell, Darkspell and I&#8217;m onto The Bristling Wood (basically &#8216;Act 1&#8217; as the author has described the books as being the various parts of a long play). This is an excellent series, but one that I found quite by accident.
Back when I was a fairly young kid, maybe 12 or 13, a friend of my mother was visting our house and upon realizing that I read the same type of books as him, offered to trade his set of books by David Eddings for my &#8216;Deryni&#8217; series by Katherine Kurtz.

        My buddy (and co-author on Xbox 360 For Dummies!) Brian Johnson has started a new column on Xbox.com aimed at parents &#8230; parents who game with their kids&#8230; parents whose kids play games&#8230; and even just parents who play games (gaming is different for folks who have kids in the house!).
Check out his entry about it here: Gamer Dad Column

        Ok, if you are a programmer&#8230; or even if you just can relate enough that you think Office Space is one of the best movies in the world (doesn&#8217;t everyone?) then I need you to do this:
 Go to http://www.jonathancoulton.com/songs Scroll down to &#8220;Thing a Week III&#8221; Click on the play button next to Code Monkey  Enjoy!
Jonathan works on the Popular Science podcast, does music for John Hodgman&#8217;s Little Gray Books, and used to be a programmer (although I don&#8217;t think you ever stop being a programmer, you just decide to do something else with most of your time)

        Jesse and I headed over to the Xbox buildings and interviewed Deb Louis about the new Xbox 360 Wireless Headset&#8230; video coming soon! In the meantime, here are some frame captures for your enjoyment ðŸ™‚

        If you don&#8217;t already know Rory, well&#8230; keep watching Channel 9&#8230; I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll be hearing more from him through that venue soon.
For now, he has joined us over in the &#8216;dev&#8217; hallway, which I&#8217;m sure he finds quite exciting&#8230; maybe not as exciting as his Microsoft provided &#8216;temp housing&#8217;, but maybe it is close.
 &#8220;My apartment is very nice, but the complex in which it is situated is a tad on the trashy side.

        Interesting news, content that is only for Xbox Live Gold members&#8230; which even Tycho thinks is understandable, but I agree with his comments about what kind of content is being restricted.
 they made a serious misstep with the content they chose to inaugurate Silver&#8217;s descent into squalor: a trailer for Gears of War. An advertisement. Now, don&#8217;t get me wrong. This is really quite a trailer. The term &#8220;trailer&#8221; may even be insufficient.

        Have you seen this list of features?
Absolutely crazy list&#8230; my favorites (lots of them are great, but these are ones that either I had already been wishing for or that I know will be a big deal to me):
 Stream WMV video from a Windows PC running Windows Media Player 11, Zune software, or Windows Media Connect. Play video from storage devices such as USB flash drives, Xbox 360 Memory Units, etc.
