        I recently took an internal MSDN application that I had been running as an HREF-EXE for some months now and converted it to use the Application Updater Block{.broken_link} from PAG&#8230; it ended up taking many steps, but only a couple of hours (total) to get from start to test.. so I thought I would post my experience with integrating this new block into my application. I have placed it up as a story at http://weblogs.

        The app I am currently working on, and the one that I just recently moved from being an href-exe to being an application that updates itself via the PAG Updater Application Block, has always been located on my own Windows XP machine, that is to say&#8230; that is the web server where the .exe and other assemblies reside. Well, that causes me all sorts of problems, because it effectively makes my desktop machine into a production box, and one that many people depend upon&#8230; restarting is not a possibility, and I even try to minimize the load on the box as it will tend to wreak havoc on some of my users if I fire up 2 copies of VS.

        Hey folks, I&#8217;m not sure if you&#8217;ve seen this section of the new MSDN Developer Centers (http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/letters{.broken_link}). It is a place where the appropriate MSDN Content Strategist (me for VB, Kent for ASP.NET, etc&#8230;) gives a little blurb about the content on the site for that period of time&#8230; it is a bit bloggish in nature in fact, but with a bit more editorial polish&#8230;
Anyway, I was looking at the fairly dismal page views on this part of the vbasic site and I was wondering what would make it more appealing?

        Ok, I know that Paul knew this, but did anyone else notice that the VB.NET Try&#8230;Catch syntax{.broken_link} includes a &#8216;when&#8217; clause?
Try  [ tryStatements ] [ Catch [ exception [ As type ] ] &lt;u[ When expression ]&lt;/u [ catchStatements ] ] [ Exit Try ] ... [ Finally [ finallyStatements ] ] End Try When
Optional. A Catch statement with a When clause will only catch exceptions when expression evaluates to True.

        I&#8217;m planning to revamp this page to include &#8216;featured posts&#8217; (selected by me out of all the blogs I get my hands on, not just the ones listed on this page), but here (http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/support/community/blogs/{.broken_link}) is the first iteration of that page up on the live site. I&#8217;m interested in feedback, as always, but please hold off on &#8220;Why wasn&#8217;t my blog listed?&#8221;, space was limited in this version but I am planning to expand to additional pages at some point in the future&#8230;.

        What would you folks think if I wrote one of my MSDN articles in a serial fashion into my blog? Basically just posted each section as I wrote it? I&#8217;m considering doing this for my next Coding 4 Fun article, but before I flood your aggregator with piles of text I thought I&#8217;d look for some feedback&#8230;

        Here is a teaser for the article I am currently working on&#8230;
Keeping Work Fun Duncan Mackenzie
Microsoft Developer Network
August 8, 2003
Summary: Duncan Mackenzie describes how the &#8216;coolness&#8217; of a feature can increase its chance of being finished early on in a development project.
People Keep Making me Work If you&#8217;ve been following my columns, you probably think that I spend all my time writing up fun and cool code samples without having to work on anything boring.

        Continuing along with the rest of the article, I start to layout the basic design of what I am about to build&#8230;
Designing our New Feature As a fairly low-priority item, the request wasn&#8217;t described in any more detail than that one line, but I had a pretty good idea about what folks around MSDN were looking for so I started with a rough design.
The RSS Viewer window will support the viewing of an RSS feed and the dragging of links from the feed into the rest of the system.

        With this final bit of text, this is the whole article&#8230; before any of your comments&#8230; and before my wonderful editor (Henry Borys) has attacked it. If you were to take the content from these blog entries and diff it with the published article&#8230; you&#8217;ll see the amazing impact that a good editor can have on your writing.
Storing and Retrieving the Feed Lists Once I had the RSS feeds displaying, and I had tested the system with enough sample data (translation: it worked against my blog&#8217;s feed{.

        Thanks to everyone who emailed me and offered to help&#8230; but the problem was time, not technical&#8230; despite my joke about working on the cool stuff first, a ton of high-priority stuff has made me weeks late on my article!
Although I did hit some snags with odd unsorted feeds (MSDN&#8217;s!), I managed to get everything working the way I wanted. I&#8217;m still a little unhappy with the system because I don&#8217;t strip out potentially bad tags from any HTML content included in the RSS (as per http://diveintomark.
