        A recent post{.broken_link} by Wil Wheaton manages to show his flair for descriptive writing, his complete geekness (surrender to it folks, it is the only way), and the joy a father feels when he is admired by his step son. And it does all of this while including tea in the narrative; what more could you want?

        At the end of May, Oprah is coming to Seattle to do an all day workshop&#8230; and I really wanted to get my wife (and a friend) tickets. Well, when the day of ordering came I was swamped and it totally slipped my mind until the evening&#8230; at which point it was too late. Next stop for the desperate man, eBay&#8230; lots of auctions of tickets, but once they reached up into 300 to 400% of face value, I declined to continue&#8230; so, no tickets that way.

        Ok, so the Oprah tickets{.broken_link} didn&#8217;t pan out&#8230; but I&#8217;m hoping some flowers and breakfast will see me through!

        Some{.broken_link} folks{.broken_link} have been discussing the idea of paying for technical work&#8230; well, they are actually talking about paying for technical work done over email&#8230; but what is the difference?
I need some work done, whether that is easy or hard for the person I hire isn&#8217;t relevant&#8230; and if they answer my question too quickly that certainly shouldn&#8217;t be a problem either. So why is Jeff Julian upset by this?

        I recently received a question about doing some Word automation using .NET, and I saw an interesting little difference between the C# and VB.NET calling into the Interop Assembly for certain properties/methods&#8230;
If I take VBA or VB6 code that works, and convert it to the almost identical VB.NET code &#8230; (after adding a reference to Word in my VB.NET project);
Dim wordApp As New Word.Application() 
Dim newDoc As Word.

        Since starting my column{.broken_link}, I&#8217;ve received quite a few requests for &#8220;just the install&#8221; from people who read the article, liked the app I built, but don&#8217;t have any interest in the code&#8230; they just want to run the app!
I never really considered that possibility, and in some cases I didn&#8217;t even write the code with that in mind, but now I&#8217;m wondering if I should at least provide a built install file in with the downloadable code sample for non-programmers&#8230; weird thought.

        This recent MSDN magazine article{.broken_link} is pretty cool. Although the title suggests it is all about Zip Compression, the real power of this article is that it points out that the J# libraries are available from any .NET language, providing your C#/VB.NET apps with a lot more than just zip support (although that is pretty neat too).

        My wife just did a count, and my upcoming move into a house will be my 15th or 16th move between residences (although some of those were within the same city). Hmm&#8230; I&#8217;m averaging less than 2 yrs per location&#8230; I suspect this next move will be for quite a bit longer!
